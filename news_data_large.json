Ltd. (Hsinchu, Taiwan) has been issued patent number 12237276, according to news reporting originating out of Alexandria, Virginia, by NewsRx editors.\n\nThe patent's inventors are Jeng, Shin-Puu (Hsinchu, TW), Lai, Po-Chen (Hsinchu County, TW), Lin, Po-Yao (Hsinchu County, TW), Wang, Chin-Hua (New Taipei, TW), Yang, Che-Chia (Taipei, TW), Yeh, Shu-Shen (Taoyuan, TW), Yew, Ming-Chih (Hsinchu, TW).\n\nThis patent was filed on June 16, 2023 and was published online on February 25, 2025.\n\nFrom the background information supplied by the inventors, news correspondents obtained the following quote: \"The semiconductor integrated circuit (IC) industry has experienced rapid growth. Continuing advances in semiconductor manufacturing processes have resulted in semiconductor devices with finer features and\/or higher degrees of integration. Functional density (i.e., the number of interconnected devices per chip area) has generally increased while feature size (i.e., the smallest component that can be created using a fabrication process) has decreased. This scaling-down process generally provides benefits by increasing production efficiency and lowering associated costs.\n\n\"A chip package not only provides protection for semiconductor devices from environmental contaminants, but also provides a connection interface for the semiconductor devices packaged therein. Smaller package structures, which utilize a smaller area or are lower in height, have been developed to package the semiconductor devices.\n\n\"New packaging technologies have been developed to further improve the density and functionalities of semiconductor dies. These relatively new types of packaging technologies for semiconductor dies face manufacturing challenges.\"\n\nSupplementing the background information on this patent, NewsRx reporters also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: \"The following disclosure provides many different embodiments, or examples, for implementing different features of the provided subject matter.

For example, the formation of a first feature over or on a second feature in the description that follows may include embodiments in which the first and second features are formed in direct contact, and may also include embodiments in which additional features may be formed between the first and second features, such that the first and second features may not be in direct contact. In addition, the present disclosure may repeat reference numerals and\/or letters in the various examples. This repetition is for the purpose of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and\/or configurations discussed.\n\n\"Further, spatially relative terms, such as \"beneath,\" \"below,\" \"lower,\" \"above,\" \"upper\" and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. The spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. The apparatus may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein may likewise be interpreted accordingly.\n\n\"The term \"substantially\" in the description, such as in \"substantially flat\" or in \"substantially coplanar\", etc., will be understood by the person skilled in the art. In some embodiments the adjective substantially may be removed. Where applicable, the term \"substantially\" may also include embodiments with \"entirely\", \"completely\", \"all\", etc. Where applicable, the term \"substantially\" may also relate to 90% or higher, such as 95% or higher, especially 99% or higher, including 100%. Furthermore, terms such as \"substantially parallel\" or \"substantially perpendicular\" are to be interpreted as not to exclude insignificant deviation from the specified arrangement and may include for example deviations of up to 10\u00b0. The word \"substantially\" does not exclude \"completely\" e.g. a composition which is \"substantially free\" from Y may be completely free from Y.\n\n\"Terms such as \"about\" in conjunction with a specific distance or size are to be interpreted so as not to exclude insignificant deviation from the specified distance or size and may include for example deviations of up to 10%. The term \"about\" in relation to a numerical value x may mean x\u00b15 or 10%.\n\n\"Some embodiments of the disclosure are described.

(Hsinchu, Taiwan) has been issued patent number 12237280, according to news reporting originating out of Alexandria, Virginia, by NewsRx editors.\n\nThe patent's inventors are Jiang, Jheng-Hong (Hsinchu, TW), Liu, Chia-Wei (Zhubei, TW), Wu, Shing-Huang (Hsinchu, TW).\n\nThis patent was filed on July 31, 2023 and was published online on February 25, 2025.\n\nFrom the background information supplied by the inventors, news correspondents obtained the following quote: \"Embedded capacitors are used in semiconductor chips for a variety of applications. However, semiconductor structures, such as radio-frequency cavity resonator structures, used in radio-frequency applications may be exposed during long manufacturing times, increasing the risk of structural damage including corrosion.\"\n\nSupplementing the background information on this patent, NewsRx reporters also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: \"The following disclosure provides many different embodiments, or examples, for implementing different features of the provided subject matter. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. For example, the formation of a first feature over or on a second feature in the description that follows may include embodiments in which the first and second features are formed in direct contact, and may also include embodiments in which additional features may be formed between the first and second features, such that the first and second features may not be in direct contact. In addition, the present disclosure may repeat reference numerals and\/or letters in the various examples. This repetition is for the purpose of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and\/or configurations discussed.\n\n\"Further, spatially relative terms, such as \"beneath,\" \"below,\" \"lower,\" \"above,\" \"upper\" and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. The spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. The apparatus may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein may likewise be interpreted accordingly.\n\n\"In overview, various embodiments directed to semiconductor devices are disclosed. Specifically, embodiments directed to radio-frequency (RF) resonator semiconductor structures including two or more resonator trenches and methods of forming the same. Various embodiment structures and methods may be used to reduce or eliminate adverse impacts of long manufacturing times. The various embodiment structures and methods may also be used to reduce and\/or eliminate corrosion that occurs during these long etching processes, the various aspects of which are described herebelow.\n\n\"Etching processes may be simultaneously time-sensitive and time-consuming. In particular, in semiconductor dies that include a large array of devices such as RF resonators and resonating circuits for detecting, measuring, and\/or emitting RF signals, the etching processes used to form such array of devices may be time-sensitive and time-consuming. Etching processes may be time sensitive such that the formation of all required RF-related semiconductor structures within a single die may require multiple deposition and etching steps, during which conductive metals may be exposed to remnant etching gases. Such long exposures to etchant gases may result in corrosion of layers and materials. Long manufacturing times may cause F-pad buildup, or buildup of trench etching remnant gases (e.g., fluorine). Remnant etching gases exposed to oxygen during the time-consuming etching processes may react to create moisture, which may create a metal surface crystal defect (i.e., corrosion). Moisture caused by remnant etching gases may also be trapped under additional deposited layers, causing further defects to the semiconductor die. Such defects may lead to reduction in resonator function, such as altering the resonant frequencies of a resonator or leaving the fabricated resonator inoperable altogether.\n\n\"A semiconductor die is disclosed within the present disclosure to reduce and\/or eliminate RF resonator defects such as corrosion caused by remnant etching gases. The disclosed embodiment semiconductor dies may also be improved by standardizing and reducing manufacturing times. A semiconductor die may include a graduated, \"step-like\" structure including two or more resonator trenches having various depths within a dielectric layer, or substrate, in relation to a shared capping plate within the semiconductor die. The resonator trenches may be positioned within the semiconductor die such that the varying depths of each resonator trench in relation to the shared capping plate may create distinct resonator trenches (cavities) having different resonant frequencies.

        "Story":"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing- 7 Reasons Traders Remain Bearish (and 1 Reason Why Bullish)GLOBAL ROUND UP\n\nADRS AND DEPOSITORY RECEIPTS\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (N:TSM), the International Depository Receipt (IDR) market's largest Semiconductors company by market cap, has sunk 13.1% Year To Date. There is uncertainty in the market and it is difficult to predict how economic conditions will be in 2026 and beyond as well as what the impact of those conditions may be on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. However, there are several key reasons why some investors remain bearish on the short-term prospects for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.\n\nBelow are some of those key reasons:\n\n- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's ADR price has dropped 3.1% from its previous trading session to close at $171.59.\n\n- Bearish Kicker Candlestick chart pattern: A Bearish Kicker Candlestick Chart pattern is one of the most reliable reversal patterns formed at the end of an uptrend, when it encounters resistance in an overbought area.\n\n- The ADR has a 1-month relative price strength of 28 indicating it is trailing 72% of the market. A price fall combined with a slipping relative strength is a bearish signal.\n\n- Short-Term Technical Ranking 2 out of 5 [5 is best]: ADRs are scored on a set of technical parameters reflecting price performance, overbought\/ oversold levels and trading volumes. They are ranked according to the bullish\/bearish values of those parameters. The highest ranking is 5 and the lowest ranking is 1.\n\n- The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator of 12-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of 179.0 minus the 26-day EMA of 187.2 is negative, suggesting a bearish signal. The price to 50-day EMAP ratio is 0.9, a bearish indicator.\n\n- Both the 12-day EMA as well as the 26-day EMA are falling.\n\n- The ADR is down in last 5 days 2.4% and 17.8% for past month.\n\nHowever, there is at least one reason investors may remain bullish in the short-term:\n\n- The ADR is trading above both its MAPs and the 50-day MAP of 195.4 is higher than the 200-day MAP of 176.4, a bullish indicator.\n\nTAIWAN SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING (TSM) ADR Dashboard End-of-Day Thu, Mar 13\n\nhttp:\/\/www.tsmc.com.tw\n\nLast                              $171.59                                                            \n52-Week Price Range               $124.52 - $226.40                                                  \nAve Daily Volume                  15,887,261 ADRs                                                    \nToday's Volume [VI]               14,381,500 [0.9]                                                   \nMarket Cap                        $891 billion                                                       \nExchange                          INTERNATIONAL DEPOSITORY RECEIPTS [Frankfurt, USNYSE, Stuttgart]   \nEPS (FY2023)                      $32.34                                                             \nEPS Growth (Q3 2024 vs Q2 2024)   31.3                                                               \nShares Outstanding                5,190,000,000                                                      \nInstitutional Ownership           % of shares outstanding 16%                                        \nTSM in Indices                    BNY Mellon Composite ADR [of 194 stocks]                           \nSector                            Semiconductors [Rank by MCap 1 of 20 stocks]                       \nPV$1000 (1 yr) and TRS            $1,241; 24.1%                                                      \n\nVI* Volume Index = Number of shares traded today\/Average number of shares traded per day.\n\nA year ago the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing adr price was $140.17. $1,000 would have bought 7.1 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing adrs on that day.

(Nasdaq: GSIT), the inventor of the Associative Processing Unit (APU), a paradigm shift in AI and HPC processing providing true compute-in-memory technology, today reiterated the key highlights from its recent earnings call for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 held on Thursday, May 2, 2024.\n\nKey Business Updates from Earnings Call\n\nKey Highlights from Gemini-II Update on Earnings Call\n\nEngaging Needham & Company underscores our proactive approach to fortifying our market position and financial health and maximizing stockholder value, said Lee-Lean Shu, CEO of GSI Technology. We are making excellent progress with our second generation of the APU, Gemini-II, and are extremely encouraged by the chip's results in testing, which has verified that instructions can be successfully executed through the embedded processor and that the data path is also working. Once we receive the second spin of Gemini-II this fall, we intend to initiate benchmarking that will allow us to begin preliminary customer sampling and engage with target customers before the calendar year-end.\n\nThe second generation of our APU brings significant performance enhancements, with more processing power and memory density, and suitable for both low power data center expansion and enabling data center functions at the edge, continued Mr. Shu. These capabilities empower local execution of computationally intensive tasks, increasing edge application capabilities. Additionally, Gemini-IIs memory can hold an entire small database, a potential door-opener for enhanced performance in image recognition applications. These small model sizes use algorithms with low precision model weight size to lower memory storage requirements and simplify computations, which the APU architecture is better suited for than traditional GPU architectures.\n\nPress Release article 14 of 18, Source: West Corporation, 71 words\n\nMay 02 2024: GSI Technology, Inc.

(Nasdaq: GSIT), the inventor of the Associative Processing Unit (APU), a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance compute (HPC) processing providing true compute-in-memory technology, today announced the release in production of two high capacity, low power server products. The Leda-E and Leda-S boards incorporate the Gemini-I APU, capable of 1.2 POPs at 80W and 800 TOPs at 40W, respectively. The new server offerings are available as a single 2U server of eight Leda-E boards at 10 POPs, and a 1U server of sixteen Leda-S boards, totaling 13 POPs.\n\nGSI's true compute-in-memory technology has proven differentiated capabilities in large (billion item) database search and high-performancecomputeapplications, such as facial recognition, drug discovery, Opensearch, and object detection and re-identification. The low 1.2kW full server power of these formidable systems unlocks the potential for the 1U server to be used in mobile or remote applications.\n\nSingle card versions of the Gemini-I have shown six-fold performance improvement over the Xeon CPU for seed location filtering in DNA read mapping by Cornell University1. Similarly, the Gemini-I has shown equivalent performance to the A100 for cryptography applications, such as high throughput hash-based security protocols, as demonstrated by Northern Arizona University (NAU)2. NAU found that an 8-card APU server would be compelling for further evaluation due to its smaller form factor in a 2U server compared to an equivalent A100 GPU system.\n\nServer systems based on GSIs production Gemini-I APU chip come pre-bundled with an application development compiler and can be further customized with Real-Time Fast Back Projection software or Fast Vector Search support.\n\nSystems are shipping from stock.\n\nPress Release article 17 of 18, 281 words\n\nMarch 31 2024: GSI Technology: File SEC Form 10-K - Management's Discussion and Analysis 10-K\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Our initial associative processing unit (\"APU\") products are focused on applications using similarity search, but have not resulted in material revenues to date. Similarity search is used in visual search queries for ecommerce, computer vision, drug discovery, cybersecurity and service markets such as NoSQL, Elasticsearch, and OpenSearch. We have solutions to accelerate multimodal vector search as an on-prem or SaaS solution for OpenSearch and general Fast Vector Search, and for processing large area SAR images in real-time at high resolution. We also design, develop and market static random access memories, or SRAMs (our current primary revenue source), that operate at speeds of less than 10 nanoseconds, which we refer to as Very Fast SRAMs, primarily for the networking and telecommunications and the military\/defense and aerospace markets. We are subject to the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, which has experienced significant fluctuations, often in connection with fluctuations in demand for the products in which semiconductor devices are used. Our revenues have been substantially impacted by significant fluctuations in sales to our largest customer, Nokia. We expect that future direct and indirect sales to Nokia will continue to fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. The networking and telecommunications market has accounted for a significant portion of our net revenues in the past and has declined during the past several years and is expected to continue to decline. In anticipation of the decline of the networking and telecommunications market, we have been using the revenue generated by the sales of high-speed synchronous SRAM products to finance the development of our new in-place associative computing solutions and the marketing and sale of new types of SRAM products such as radiation-hardened and radiation-tolerant SRAMs.\n\nOur revenues in recent years were impacted by changes in customer buying patterns and communication limitations related to COVID-19 restrictions that required a significant number of our customer contacts to work from home. While the COVID-19 pandemic has ended, worldwide inflationary pressures, higher interest rates and decline in the global economic environment have had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and financial condition. Furthermore, the easing of supply chain shortages and prior buffer stock purchases from significant customers led to a decrease in revenues in the second half of fiscal 2023 and during fiscal 2024.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $14.4 million, with no debt. We have a team in-place with tremendous depth and breadth of experience and knowledge, with a legacy business that is providing an ongoing source of funding for the development of new product lines. Our balance sheet and liquidity position has been strengthened by the recent sale of our Sunnyvale, California property, which we anticipate will provide further financial flexibility and security in the current environment of economic uncertainty. Generally, our primary source of liquidity is cash equivalents. Our level of cash equivalents has historically been sufficient to meet our current and\n\nlonger term operating and capital needs. We believe that during the next 12 months, continued inflationary pressures and higher interest rates will continue to negatively impact general economic activity and demand in our end markets. Although it is difficult to estimate the length or gravity of the continued inflationary pressures and higher interest rates, the evolving conflict in the Middle East and the decline in the global economic environment, are expected to have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, including potential impairments, and liquidity into fiscal 2025.\n\nRevenues. Substantially all of our revenues are derived from sales of our Very Fast SRAM products. Sales to networking and telecommunications OEMs accounted for 32% to 49% of our net revenues during our last three fiscal years. We also sell our products to OEMs that manufacture products for military and aerospace applications such as radar and guidance systems and satellites, for test and measurement applications such as high-speed testers, for automotive applications such as smart cruise control, and for medical applications such as ultrasound and CAT scan equipment.\n\nAs is typical in the semiconductor industry, the selling prices of our products generally decline over the life of the product. Our ability to increase net revenues, therefore, is dependent upon our ability to increase unit sales volumes of existing products and to introduce and sell new products with higher average selling prices in quantities sufficient to compensate for the anticipated declines in selling prices of our more mature products. Although we expect the average selling prices of individual products to decline over time, we believe that, over the next several quarters, our overall average selling prices will increase due to a continuing shift in product mix to a higher percentage of higher price, higher density products, and to a lesser extent, recent price increases to our customers due to supply constraints. Our ability to increase unit sales volumes is dependent primarily upon increases in customer demand but, particularly in periods of increasing demand, can also be affected by our ability to increase production through the availability of increased wafer fabrication capacity from TSMC, our wafer supplier, and our ability to increase the number of good integrated circuit die produced from each wafer through die size reductions and yield enhancement activities.\n\nWe may experience fluctuations in quarterly net revenues for a number of reasons. Historically, orders on hand at the beginning of each quarter are insufficient to meet our revenue objectives for that quarter and are generally cancelable up to 30 days prior to scheduled delivery. Accordingly, we depend on obtaining and shipping orders in the same quarter to achieve our revenue objectives. In addition, the timing of product releases, purchase orders and product availability could result in significant product shipments at the end of a quarter. Failure to ship these products by the end of the quarter may adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, our customers may delay scheduled delivery dates and\/or cancel orders within specified timeframes without significant penalty.\n\nWe sell our products through our direct sales force, international and domestic sales representatives and distributors. Our revenues have been and are expected to continue to be impacted by changes in customer buying patterns and communication limitations related to changes in working habits that have resulted in a significant number of our customer contacts working from home. Our customer contracts, which may be in the form of purchase orders, contracts or purchase agreements, contain performance obligations for delivery of agreed upon products. Delivery of all performance obligations contained within a contract with a customer typically occurs at the same time (or within the same accounting period). Transfer of control occurs at the time of shipment, title and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, and we have a right to payment. Thus, we will recognize revenue upon shipment of the product for direct sales and sales to our distributors.\n\nHistorically, a small number of OEM customers have accounted for a substantial portion of our net revenues, and we expect that significant customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future. Many of our OEMs use contract manufacturers to manufacture their equipment. Accordingly, a significant percentage of our net revenues is derived from sales to these contract manufacturers. In addition, a significant portion of our sales are\n\nmade to foreign and domestic distributors who resell our products to OEMs, as well as their contract manufacturers. Direct sales to contract manufacturers accounted for 20.5%, 19.8% and 31.0% of our net revenues for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Sales to foreign and domestic distributors accounted for 76.4%, 77.5% and 66.8% of our net revenues for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The following direct customers accounted for 10% or more of our net revenues in one or more of the following periods:\n\nNokia was our largest customer in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022. Nokia purchases products directly from us and through contract manufacturers and distributors. Based on information provided to us by its contract manufacturers and our distributors, purchases by Nokia represented approximately 21%, 17% and 29% of our net revenues in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our revenues have been substantially impacted by significant fluctuations in sales to Nokia, and we expect that future direct and indirect sales to Nokia will continue to fluctuate substantially on a quarterly basis and that such fluctuations may significantly affect our operating results in future periods. To our knowledge, none of our other OEM customers accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues in fiscal 2024, 2023 or 2022.\n\nCost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues consists primarily of wafer fabrication costs, wafer sort, assembly, test and burn-in expenses, the amortized cost of production mask sets, stock-based compensation and the cost of materials and overhead from operations. All of our wafer manufacturing and assembly operations, and a significant portion of our wafer sort testing operations, are outsourced. Accordingly, most of our cost of revenues consists of payments to TSMC and independent assembly and test houses. Because we do not have long-term, fixed-price supply contracts, our wafer fabrication, assembly and other outsourced manufacturing costs are subject to the cyclical fluctuations in demand for semiconductors. We have experienced increased costs as a result of supply chain constraints for wafers and outsourced assembly, burn-in and test operations. We review our manufacturing costs on a regular basis and pass on any cost increases to our customers when it makes sense to do so. Cost of revenues also includes expenses related to supply chain management, quality assurance, and final product testing and documentation control activities conducted at our headquarters in Sunnyvale, California and our branch operations in Taiwan.\n\nGross Profit. Our gross profit margins vary among our products and are generally greater on our radiation hardened and radiation tolerant SRAMs, on our higher density products and, within a particular density, greater on our higher speed and industrial temperature products. We expect that our overall gross margins will fluctuate from period to period as a result of shifts in product mix, changes in average selling prices and our ability to control our cost of revenues, including costs associated with outsourced wafer fabrication and product assembly and testing.\n\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for design engineers and other technical personnel, the cost of developing prototypes, stock-based compensation and fees paid to consultants. We charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred. We charge mask costs used in production to cost of revenues over a 12-month period. However, we charge costs related to pre-production mask sets, which are not used in production, to research and development expenses at the time they are incurred. These charges often arise as we transition to new process technologies and, accordingly,\n\ncan cause research and development expenses to fluctuate on a quarterly basis. We incurred charges of $2.4 million for a pre-production mask set for our APU2 during the quarter ended December 31, 2023. We believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to our long-term success, and we expect to continue to devote significant resources to product development activities. In particular, we are devoting substantial resources to the development of our in-place associative computing products. Accordingly, we expect that our research and development expenses will continue to be substantial in future periods and may lead to operating losses in some periods. Such expenses as a percentage of net revenues may fluctuate from period to period.\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of commissions paid to independent sales representatives, salaries, stock-based compensation and related expenses for personnel engaged in sales, marketing, administrative, finance and human resources activities, professional fees, costs associated with the promotion of our products and other corporate expenses. We expect that our sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods if we are able to grow and expand our sales force but that, to the extent our revenues increase in future periods, these expenses will generally decline as a percentage of net revenues. We also expect that, in support of any future growth that we are able to achieve, general and administrative expenses will generally increase in absolute dollars.\n\nAcquisition:\n\nOn November 23, 2015, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of privately held MikaMonu Group Ltd. (\"MikaMonu\"), a development-stage, Israel-based company that specialized in in-place associative computing for markets including big data, computer vision and cyber security. MikaMonu, located in Tel Aviv, held 12 United States patents and had a number of pending patent applications.\n\nThe acquisition was undertaken in order to gain access to the MikaMonu patents and the potential markets, and new customer base in those markets, that can be served by new products that we are developing using the in-place associative computing technology.\n\nThe acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase under authoritative guidance for business combinations. The purchase price of the acquisition was allocated to the intangible assets acquired, with the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired recorded as goodwill. We perform a goodwill impairment test near the end of each fiscal year and if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on an interim basis.\n\nThe acquisition agreement provides for potential \"earnout\" payments to the former MikaMonu shareholders in cash or shares of our common stock, at our discretion, during a period of up to ten years following the closing if certain revenue targets for products based on the MikaMonu technology are achieved. Earnout payments, up to a maximum of $30.0 million, equal to 5% of net revenues from the sale of qualifying products in excess of certain thresholds, will be made quarterly through December 31, 2025. As of March 31, 2024, none of the revenue targets have been achieved and no revenue based earnout payments have been paid to the former MikaMonu shareholders.\n\nThe maximum amount of the remaining potential earnout payments totals approximately $30.0 million at March 31, 2024. We determined that the fair value of this contingent consideration liability was $5.8 million at the acquisition date. The contingent consideration liability is included in contingent consideration, non-current on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at March 31, 2023 and 2024 in the amount of $1.1 million and $160,000, respectively\n\nAt each reporting period, the contingent consideration liability is re-measured at then current fair value with changes recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Changes in any of the inputs may result in significant adjustments to the recorded fair value. Re-measurement of the contingent consideration liability during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 resulted in a decrease of the contingent consideration liability of $0.9 million.\n\nThe allocation of the purchase price to acquired identifiable intangible assets and goodwill was based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The fair value allocated to patents was $3.5 million and the residual value allocated to goodwill was $8.0 million.\n\nResults of Operations Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2024 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2023\n\nNet Revenues. Net revenues decreased by 26.7% from $29.7 million in fiscal 2023 to $21.8 million in fiscal 2024. The overall average selling price of all units shipped in fiscal 2024 increased by 20.8% in fiscal 2024 compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease in net revenues is related to the current economic environment which has led to cautionary spending by our customers and purchases made as a result of supply chain constraints in the previous periods. Units shipped decreased by 39.3% in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. The networking and telecommunications markets represented 34% and 32% of shipments in fiscal 2024 and in fiscal 2023, respectively. Direct and indirect sales to Nokia, currently our largest customer, decreased by $500,000 from $5.0 million in fiscal 2023 to $4.5 million fiscal 2024. Shipments to Nokia will continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of demand and shipments to its end customers. While recent customer order patterns have been particularly variable, these fluctuations are related to economic and external factors, which include worldwide inflationary pressures, higher interest rates and the decline in the global economic environment. Shipments of our SigmaQuad product line accounted for 51.2% of total shipments in fiscal 2024 compared to 49.1% of total shipments in fiscal 2023\n\nCost of Revenues. Cost of revenues decreased by 17.2% from $12.0 million in fiscal 2023 to $9.9 million in fiscal 2024. Cost of revenues decreased as a result of the lower volume of units shipped in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 as discussed above. Cost of revenues included a provision for excess and obsolete inventories of $180,000 in fiscal 2024 compared to $226,000 in fiscal 2023. Cost of revenues included stock-based compensation expense of $228,000 and $202,000, respectively, in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023.\n\nGross Profit. Gross profit decreased by 33.1% from $17.7 million in fiscal 2023 to $11.8 million in fiscal 2024. Gross margin decreased from 59.6% in fiscal 2023 to 54.3% in fiscal 2024. The change in gross profit is primarily related to the change in net revenues discussed above. The decrease in gross margin was primarily related to change in the mix of products and customers and also reflects the impact of fixed overhead on lower shipment levels compared to the prior year. Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses decreased 7.9% from $23.6 million in fiscal 2023 to $21.7 million in fiscal 2024. The reduction in research and development spending in fiscal 2024 reflects the impact of cost reduction measures implemented in the quarter ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in research and development spending was primarily related to decreases of $2.2 million in payroll related expenses and $1.4 million in outside consulting expenses for the development of our APU-2 product. The decrease in research and development spending was partially offset by an increase in pre-production mask costs of $2.4 million related to our APU-2 product. Research and development expenses in fiscal 2024 were also offset by $435,000 of funding received under the Direct to Phase II award for the development of a Next-Generation Associative Processing Unit-2 for Enhanced Space-Based Capabilities. Research and development expenses included stock-based compensation expense of $1.4 million and $1.3 million in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively.\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 6.3% from $9.9 million in fiscal 2023 to $10.6 million in fiscal 2024. In fiscal 2024, the value of contingent consideration liability resulting from the MikaMonu acquisition decreased by $892,000 compared to a decrease of $1.7 million in fiscal 2023 as a result of re-measurement of contingent consideration liability in each year. Decreases of $554,000 in payroll related expenses and $196,000 in outside sales representative commissions were partially offset by increases of $284,000 in outside consultants and $234,000 in professional fees. Selling, general and administrative expenses included stock-based compensation expense of $1.2 million and $951,000 in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively.\n\nInterest Income and Other (Expense), Net. Interest income and other (expense), net increased from income of $202,000 in fiscal 2023 to income of $414,000 in fiscal 2024. Interest income increased by $232,000 due to higher interest rates received on cash and short-term investments. The foreign currency exchange loss increased from ($121,000) in fiscal 2023 to ($127,000) in fiscal 2024. The exchange loss in each period was primarily related to our Taiwan branch operations and operations in Israel.\n\nProvision (benefit) for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes decreased from $372,000 in fiscal 2023 to $70,000 in fiscal 2024. The provision for income taxes in fiscal 2024 included a benefit of ($117,000) related to the approval by the Israel tax authorities of a \"Preferred Company\" tax rate that was retroactively applied to fiscal 2023. Because we recorded a cumulative three-year loss on a U.S. tax basis for the year ended March 31, 2024 and the realization of our deferred tax assets is questionable, we recorded a tax provision reflecting a valuation allowance of $20.2 million in net deferred tax assets in fiscal 2024. Reductions in uncertain tax benefits due to lapses in the statute of limitations were not significant in the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nNet Loss. Net loss was ($16.0) million in fiscal 2023 compared to a net loss of ($20.1) million in fiscal 2024. This decrease was primarily due to the changes in net revenues, gross profit and operating expenses discussed above.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources:\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of $14.4 million compared to $30.6 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of March 31, 2023. Cash and cash equivalents totaling $9.4 million were held in foreign locations as of March 31, 2024.\n\nNet cash used in operating activities was $17.4 million and $16.8 million for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively. The primary uses of cash in fiscal 2024 were the net loss of $20.1 million and a decrease of $1.6 million in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The reduction in accrued expenses and other liabilities was primarily related to decreases in compensation related accruals, income taxes payable and deferred revenue. The uses of cash in fiscal 2024 were less than the net loss due to non-cash items including stock-based compensation of\n\n$2.8 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $927,000. The primary source of cash in fiscal 2024 was a decrease in inventories of $1.3 million.\n\nThe primary uses of cash in fiscal 2023 were the net loss of $16.0 million, a reduction in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $2.3 million and an increase in inventories of $2.0 million. The reduction in accrued expenses and other liabilities was primarily related to the payment of fiscal 2022 year-end accruals for incentive compensation. The uses of cash in fiscal 2023 were less than the net loss due to non-cash items including stock-based compensation of $2.5 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $1.0 million. The primary source of cash in fiscal 2023 was a decrease in accounts receivable of $1.1 million.\n\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $2.8 million and $6.7 million in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. Investment activities in fiscal 2024 primarily consisted of the maturity of certificates of deposit and agency bonds of $3.4 million partially offset by the purchase of property and equipment of $645,000. Investment activities in fiscal 2023 primarily consisted of the maturity of certificates of deposit and agency bonds of $7.0 million partially offset by the purchase of property and equipment of $316,000.\n\nCash provided by financing activities was $1.8 million and $402,000 in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively and consisted of the net proceeds from the sale of common stock pursuant to our employee stock plans.\n\nAt March 31, 2024, we had total minimum lease obligations of approximately $1.6 million from April 1, 2023 through April 30, 2027, under non-cancelable operating leases for our facilities.\n\nWhile higher interest rates, worldwide inflationary pressures and the decline in the global economic environment have created significant uncertainty as to general economic and capital market conditions for the remainder of calendar 2024 and beyond, we believe that our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents, and cash flow expected to be generated from our future operations and the net proceeds of approximately $11.2 million from the sale of our headquarters building in Sunnyvale, CA which closed on June 6, 2024 will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including revenue growth, if any, that we experience, any additional manufacturing cost increases resulting from supply constraints and the continuation of the impact of higher interest rates and inflation may have on our business, the extent to which we utilize subcontractors, the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain, the timing and extent of spending to support our product development efforts and the expansion of our sales and marketing team. Additional capital may also be required for the consummation of any acquisition of businesses, products or technologies that we may undertake. On June 28, 2023, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3, which was declared effective by the SEC on July 19, 2023. On August 1, 2023, we commenced a registered securities offering pursuant to a Sales Agreement (the \"Sales Agreement\") with Needham & Company, LLC (\"Needham\"). The Sales Agreement provides that we may offer and sell our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $25.0 million from time to time (the \"Offering\") through Needham, acting as our sales agent. We sold 133,000 shares pursuant to the offering at an average price of $4.20 for proceeds of $542,000, less offering costs of $389,000 during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. We cannot assure that additional equity or debt financing, if required, will be available on terms that are acceptable or at all.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had $2.2 million in purchase obligations for facility leases, wafers and software and test purchase obligations that are binding commitments, of which $1.2 million are payable in the next twelve months and $1.0 million are committed in the long term.\n\nIn connection with the acquisition of MikaMonu on November 23, 2015, we are required to make contingent consideration payments to the former MikaMonu shareholders conditioned upon the achievement of certain revenue\n\ntargets for products based on the MikaMonu technology. As of March 31, 2024, the accrual for potential payment of contingent consideration was $160,000.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates:\n\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\") requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates are inherent in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and include estimates affecting obsolete and excess inventory and contingent consideration. We believe that we consistently apply these judgments and estimates and that our financial statements and accompanying notes fairly represent our financial results for all periods presented. However, any errors in these judgments and estimates may have a material impact on our balance sheet and statement of operations. Critical accounting estimates, as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult and subjective judgments and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our critical accounting estimates include those regarding the valuation of inventories and contingent consideration.\n\nValuation of Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, cost being determined on a weighted average basis. Our inventory write-down allowance is established when conditions indicate that the selling price of our products could be less than cost due to physical deterioration, obsolescence based on changes in technology and demand, changes in price levels, or other causes. We consider the need to establish the allowance for excess inventory generally based on inventory levels in excess of 12 months of forecasted customer demand for each specific product, which is based on historical sales and expected future orders. At any point in time, some portion of our inventory is subject to the risk of being materially in excess of our projected demand. Additionally, our average selling prices could decline due to market or other conditions, which creates a risk that costs of manufacturing our inventory may not be recovered. These factors contribute to the risk that we may be required to record additional inventory write-downs in the future, which could be material. In addition, if actual market conditions are more favorable than expected, inventory previously written down may be sold to customers resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period.\n\nContingent Consideration. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability potentially payable in connection with our acquisition of MikaMonu was initially determined as of the acquisition date using unobservable inputs. These inputs included the estimated amount and timing of future revenue, the probability of achievement of the revenue forecast, and a risk-adjusted discount rate to adjust the probability-weighted cash flow payments to their present value. Since the acquisition date, at each reporting period, the contingent consideration liability is re-measured at its then current fair value with changes recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Due to revisions to the amount of expected revenue, the timing of revenue to be recognized prior to the end of the earnout period and the probability of achievement of the APU revenue forecast, the contingent consideration liability decreased by $892,000 from March 31, 2023 to March 31, 2024. Future changes to any of the inputs, including forecasted revenues from a new product, which are inherently difficult to estimate, or the valuation model selected, may result in material adjustments to the recorded fair value.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements:\n\nPlease refer to Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements appearing under Part II, Item 8 for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that may impact the Company.\n\nSECTION 5 INSTITUTIONAL OWNERSHIP UPDATED AFTER LAST SEC FILING Q4\/2024 REPORTED ON FEB 17\n\nInstitutional Ownership as at Dec 31, 2024\n\n5.1 Reported holdings of institutions end of quarter\n\nAs at December 31, 2024 institutions had decreased their holdings to 10.5% of issued capital, down from 11.7% nine months ago.\n\nQuarter - ended       Dec 31, 2024   Sep 30, 2024   Jun 30, 2024   Mar 31, 2024   \n% of issued capital   10.5           10.2           10.5           11.7           \n\n5.2 Top 5 Institutional Ownership of GSI Technology as at December 31, 2024\n\nAs at December 31, 2024, 34 Institutions (Funds) held investments in shares of GSI Technology.

        "Story":"This Top Chipmaker Stock Has Rallied More Than 200% in 5 Years, and It Still Looks Like a Cheap BuyMar 14, 2025\n\nInvesting in tech stocks right now can look like a dangerous proposition, given the weakness in the markets of late. If tariffs and trade wars sink the economy into a recession, tech spending could come under pressure, and the growth in artificial intelligence (AI) could slow drastically.\n\nThat's why it's crucial for investors to pay attention to valuations and buy stocks that aren't trading at obscene earnings multiples. One stock that AI investors should consider loading up on today is chipmaking giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), or TSMC, which has amassed impressive 200% gains over the past five years.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? \u00a0Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks\u00a0 to buy right now.\u00a0 Learn More \u00bb\n\nHere's why it still looks like a cheap buy right now.\n\nIts industry-leading position gives it a huge advantage\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor's foundry business makes up around two-thirds of the global semiconductor foundry market. It's well ahead of the competition, making it highly probable that AI chip designers will continue to rely heavily on its foundry for the foreseeable future. It can benefit from greater economies of scale, putting it in an excellent position to grow and scale while maintaining a high degree of profitability.\n\nRival Intel has been struggling to provide sustainable, long-term competition, and its foundry business has incurred significant losses. In 2024, they totaled $13.4 billion, which was nearly double the $7 billion loss the foundry unit incurred a year earlier.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor, meanwhile, expects to generate operating profit margins of around 47.5% in its first-quarter results this year. The company also recently announced plans to invest an additional $100 billion into production in the U.S., on top of the $65 billion it has planned already for manufacturing operations in Arizona. The move could help the company avoid tariffs in the U.S. while also expanding its reach.\n\nThanks to its solid earnings, the stock's valuation looks attractive\n\nTSMC's stock has seen a massive 200% stock gain over the past five years. Yet, because of the company's high profit margins\u00a0 and rapid business growth, its price-to-earnings (P\/E) multiple has remained relatively low. Currently, the stock trades at a P\/E of less than 26, which is incredibly cheap, given that the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund averages a multiple of 36.\n\nInvestors may be discounting the stock due to its Taiwan presence and the risk that could pose from potential tariffs. However, given its dominance in the chipmaking industry and its massive market share, it likely wouldn't be all that easy for U.S. tech companies to simply use other manufacturers for the sake of getting around any tariffs. Its pivotal role in the industry gives Taiwan Semiconductor a considerable competitive advantage and the potential flexibility to pass on rising costs to its customers.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor may be an underrated buy right now\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor has been a terrific stock to own over the past five years, and with much more growth still on the horizon due to AI, it may not be too late for investors to add this stock to their portfolios. It also looks to be making smart moves, such as investing in the U.S. market, which could help it minimize its risk related to tariffs while also winning over political favor and ensuring it remains a dominant force in the semiconductor foundry market for years to come.\n\nAfter trading on Tuesday, the stock has fallen 14% since the start of the year, which may be an overreaction to the threat of tariffs. In the long run, Taiwan Semiconductor looks to be a terrific investment to load up on because, for the foreseeable future, tech companies will still need to rely heavily on its foundry business to produce the chips they need for AI.\n\nDavid Jagielski has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

        "Story":"Taiwan's Central Bank predicts TSMC's US investment will have limited foreign exchange impactCentral Bank Governor Yang Chin-lung said TSMC's planned NT$3.29 trillion (US$100 billion) investment in the US will have a limited impact on Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves.\n\nYang's comment came during a report to the legislature on Thursday that included analysis from the bank's Foreign Exchange Bureau, Business Today reported. He also discussed a possible interest rate adjustment.\n\nYang said TSMC's investment will have limited impact on the foreign exchange because the company will spend the NT$3.29 trillion over several years. He said the bank's Foreign Exchange Bureau had discussed the topic with TSMC's financial department.\n\nThe bank's Foreign Exchange Bureau noted in a written report that TSMC predicts increased revenue growth. It said the company can use the US dollars earned from this growth to fund the investment, tempering the impact on foreign exchange markets.\n\nThe report noted that increased export orders after the investment may benefit Taiwan's machinery manufacturers and others. This would bring foreign currency into Taiwan, reducing the impact on foreign exchange markets.\n\nTSMC previously issued US dollar bonds when it invested in the US. The report said doing this again would also reduce the impact on foreign exchange by allowing the company to raise US dollars directly.\n\nThe Central Bank will discuss the interest rate at a board meeting next Thursday. Given possible electricity price increases, KMT Legislator Lin Te-fu asked Lung if the bank planned to increase the interest rate to prevent inflation.\n\nLung said the impact of past electricity price changes on the consumer price index was insignificant. He said the board would discuss increasing the interest rate, though added that prices are mostly stable and core inflation has remained below 2% for the past two years.\n\nAccording to the bank's report, key factors that may impact Taiwan's inflation rate include international conflicts, extreme weather events, potential increases in train fares and utility prices, and the effects of US President Donald Trump's second term.\n\nRegarding the recent record-high selloff of Taiwan stocks, Yang noted that the market has cooled since Trump took office. While he acknowledged concerns about a recession, he described the selloff as a market correction.\n\nYang also pointed out that market uncertainties could affect investments, manufacturers, and consumers, which would be detrimental to economic growth. He emphasized the need for close monitoring."

        "Story":"Chipmaker giant TSMC's USD 100 billion investment in the US unnerves many TaiwaneseMar 13, 2025\n\nMany Taiwanese are worried that Donald Trump would eventually betray Taiwan\n\nOriginally published on Global Voices\n\n[ Image removed ]\n\nImage created by OIwan Lam with Canva.\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump\u2019s temporary suspension of the shipments of U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing to Ukraine after his argument with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky at the Oval Office has prompted Taiwan to reflect on the self-ruled region\u2019s strategic relation with the U.S. in the face of China's looming threat.\u00a0\n\nTaiwan Chipmaker giant TSMC\u2019s announcement that it would invest USD 100 billion in the U.S. further intensifies Taiwan\u2019s sense of insecurity, as the deal may threaten its \u201cSilicon Shield.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cSilicon Shield\u201d at stake\n\nTaiwan makes 65 percent of the world\u2019s semiconductor chips and roughly 90 percent of the most advanced computer chips. The engine of this advanced technology is TSMC, which constitutes 15 percent of the region\u2019s GDP and 30 percent of Taiwan\u2019s stock market.\n\nIn addition to its economic value, TSMC\u2019s domination in the global chipmaking industry has political implications as it stands at the center of Taiwan\u2019s \u201cSilicon Shield\u201d \u2014 a strategy to combat China\u2019s economic and political encroachment of Taiwan by making the island globally indispensable.\n\nSince the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) became the ruling party of Taiwan with the presidential victory of Tsai Ing-wen in 2016, China has imposed economic sanctions, diplomatic pressure, and military threats to punish the self-ruled region for rejecting the \u201cOne China\u201d policy. Communist Party of China (CPC), the ruling party of the People's Republic of China (PRC), claims sovereignty over Taiwan \u2014 a self-ruled region first under Kuomingtang, the ruling party of the Republic of China (ROC) upon being defeated in the Chinese Civil War (1945\u20131949).\n\nThe \u201cSilicon Shield\u201d theory assumes that the U.S. would protect Taiwan to prevent Beijing from taking over the vital chip production nexus.\u00a0However, Trump's hostile stance toward allies and unpredictable nature have made many wonder\u00a0whether the U.S. can be relied upon as a dependable ally. Trump has accused Taiwan of inadequate defense spending and stealing America\u2019s semiconductor industry since he took the U.S. presidential office in early 2025.\u00a0\n\nWhile the Taiwanese government promised to raise its defense spending to 3 percent of its GDP in early March, Trump\u2019s national security advisor, Elbridge Colby, said Taiwan needs to spend at least 10 percent on defense.\u00a0\n\nIn addition, TSMC, with the Taiwanese government as its largest individual shareholder, announced a plan to invest USD 100 billion in building five new facilities in the U.S. The investment figure equals half of the company\u2019s USD 204 billion total assets in 2024, and by 2030, TSMC\u2019s investment in the U.S. will reach USD 165 billion.\u00a0\n\nHence, some Taiwanese described the deal as political blackmail, which would eventually undermine Taiwan\u2019s security as TSMC would face pressure to transfer its advanced production technology, increase its labour cost and hence weaken Taiwan\u2019s dominant position in advanced chip production:\n\nTaiwan\u2019s \u2018silicon shield\u2019 is under scrutiny. Trump\u2019s TSMC deal is a massive boost to U.S. chip production, but some in Taiwan fear it weakens their security. Will the island democracy lose its tech edge \u2014 and its strategic leverage? Taipei insists its most advanced AI chip\u2026 pic.twitter.com\/MzVqyADa68\n\n\u2014 Will Ripley (@willripleyCNN) March 6, 2025\n\nYet, whether the deal could keep Taiwan secure has remained in question. When asked during a press conference if the investment plan would minimise the impact on the U.S. technology sector should China decide to isolate or annex Taiwan,\u00a0Donald Trump replied:\n\n\u2026I can't say minimise, that would be a catastrophic event obviously. But it will at least give us a position where we have this very very important business we would have a very big part of it in the United States. So it would have a big impact if something should happen with Taiwan.\n\nTrump's reply has unnerved many Taiwanese people. In a popular post on Facebook, a video game blogger @cheapAOE commented on Trump's position with an allegory:\n\n\u597d\u50cf\u6709\u4e00\u68df\u623f\u5b50(\u53f0\u7063)\uff0c\u5c0d\u7f8e\u570b\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u88e1\u9762\u653e\u4e86\u503c\u9322\u7684\u6771\u897f(\u53f0\u7a4d\u96fb)\uff0c\u7136\u800c\u623f\u5b50\u65c1\u908a\u4f4f\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u5f37\u76dc(\u4e2d\u570b)\uff0c\u4e00\u76f4\u60f3\u8981\u9738\u4f54\u623f\u5b50\n\n\u7d50\u679c\u7f8e\u570b\u7684\u4f5c\u6cd5\uff0c\u662f\u628a\u5bb6\u88e1\u6700\u503c\u9322\u7684\u642c\u56de\u81ea\u5df1\u5bb6\uff0c\u4ee5\u9632\u5f37\u76dc\u771f\u7684\u9032\u4f86\uff0c\u81f3\u5c11\u9084\u80fd\u4fdd\u4f4f\u4e00\u4e9b\u8ca1\u7522\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5728\u623f\u5b50\u5468\u570d\u8a2d\u7f6e\u570d\u7246\u6216\u8acb\u4fdd\u5168\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u9ed8\u9ed8\u63a5\u53d7\uff0c\u5f37\u76dc\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u95d6\u9032\u4f86\u7684\u4e8b\u5be6\n\nIt is as if there is a house (Taiwan) that is very important to the United States because it contains valuable things (TSMC). Yet, a robber (China) who lives next door has been trying to take over the house.\n\nHowever, the U.S. way of handling the situation is to take the most valuables away from that house and store them in their own home so that if the robber breaks in, they can retain some of the property. Rather than securing the house with a wall or a guard, they just accept the reality that the robber would break in.\n\nHowever,\u00a0Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te defended the TSMC investment plan, describing it as the \u201chistorical moment\u201d of Taiwan-U.S. relations. Some analysts support Lai\u2019s explination, such as \u201cU.S.-Taiwan Watch\u201d, a Taiwanese group on Facebook:\u00a0\n\n\u73fe\u5728\u53f0\u7a4d\u96fb\u771f\u7684\u5c31\u662f\u8b77\u570b\u795e\u5c71\u4e86\uff0c\u6709\u4ed6\u5011\u93ae\u4f4f\u4e86\u6574\u500b\u7f8e\u570bMAGA\u6d3e\uff0c\u672a\u4f86\u56db\u5e74\u6211\u5011\u7684\u5730\u7de3\u653f\u6cbb\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\u662f\u5148\u5165\u888b\u4e00\u534a\u3002\u672a\u4f86\u6211\u5011\u9700\u8981\u6301\u7e8c\u8ddf\u7f8e\u570b\u6e9d\u901a\u7684\u5c31\u662f\uff0c\u7f8e\u570b\u9700\u8981\u518d\u91cb\u51fa\u66f4\u591a\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\u8a0a\u865f\uff0c\u4ee5\u963b\u6b62\u5ddd\u666e\u53e3\u4e2d\u7684\u300c\u6bc0\u6ec5\u6027\u7684\u707d\u96e3\u300d\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u8981\u518d\u66f4\u591a\u5687\u963b\u4e2d\u570b\u7684\u8a0a\u865f\u3002\n\nNow, TSMC is really the protector of the country. With them holding down the entire US MAGA faction, our geopolitical security for the next four years is partially guaranteed. In the future, we just need to persuade the U.S. to release more security signals to stop what Trump calls a \u2018catastrophe\u201d, that is, more signals to deter China.\n\nThe analysts say that it will take years to build the infrastructure and fully accomplish the plan laid out in the USD 100 billion investment, leading many to believe that the deal can prevent the \u201cMake American Great Again\u201d (MAGA) advocates from going after Taiwan on other issues, such as tariff threats.\n\n\u201cToday Ukraine, Tomorrow Taiwan\u201d\n\nHowever, their optimism is not widely shared. Doubt and anxiety about the U.S.'s changing position in foreign politics among Taiwanese people has surged since Donald Trump\u2019s disastrous meeting with Zelensky on February 28 as the U.S. President positioned himself as a middleman to \u201cmake a deal\u201d to end Russia's war on Ukraine without addressing Ukraine\u2019s need for future security guarantees. Even worse, he accused Zelensky of not wanting peace and \u201cgambling\u201d with lives and World War III, stressing that Ukraine has \u201cno cards\u201d to bargain with. Soon after the Oval Office confrontation, Trump suspended military aid to Ukraine and even withheld crucial intelligence that has led to hundreds of deaths.\n\nBoth Taiwan and Ukraine have faced similar military threats from powerful states, namely China and Russia, which cite historical and cultural ties to justify their sovereignty over their neighbours. Both Taiwan and Ukraine had reached out to the U.S. and received substantial support from former U.S. President Joe Biden. But Trump has taken a U-turn by supporting the encroaching states which hold the so-called \u201ccards\u201d in their hands.\n\nThat\u2019s why those Taiwanese who support Ukraine are worried that Trump will eventually betray Taiwan. A post shared on Taiwanese Ukraine Concern Group, for example, commented:\n\n\u4ed6\u6b63\u5728\u6539\u8b8a\u9019\u500b\u4e16\u754c\u5c0d\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u548c\u5e73\u7684\u5b9a\u7fa9\u8d70\u5411\u53e2\u6797\u6cd5\u5247\uff0c\u7136\u800c\u9019\u6a23\u7684\u6cd5\u5247\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u4e0d\u5229\u65bc\u5c0f\u570b\u7684\u751f\u5b58\uff0c\u6bd4\u62f3\u982d\u6211\u5011\u6bd4\u4e0d\u904e\u4e2d\u570b\uff0c\u7576\u53f0\u7063\u6709\u4e86\u9ebb\u9ebb\u7169\u5ddd\u666e\u4e5f\u4e0d\u6703\u548c\u6211\u5011\u8b1b\u9053\u7fa9\uff0c\u4ed6\u53ea\u8981\u53f0\u7a4d\u96fb\u5c31\u50cf\u4ed6\u53ea\u8981\u70cf\u514b\u862d\u7684\u7926\u7522\u4e00\u6a23\u3002\n\n\u7b49\u5230\u6211\u5011\u6709\u9700\u6c42\u65bc\u4ed6\uff0c\u90a3\u500b\u88ab\u7f9e\u8fb1\u88ab\u9738\u51cc\u7684\u5c31\u6703\u662f\u53f0\u7063\uff0c\u5ddd\u666e\u65e2\u8d70\u5411\u5b64\u7acb\u4e3b\u7fa9\uff0c\u4ed6\u4e5f\u4e0d\u6703\u5728\u4e9e\u592a\u6295\u5165\u66f4\u591a\u5175\u529b\u548c\u8cc7\u91d1\u53bb\u7dad\u6301\u7b2c\u4e00\u5cf6\u93c8\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u548c\u4e2d\u5171\u7576\u597d\u670b\u53cb\u9322\u5c31\u76f4\u63a5\u7701\u4e0b\u4f86\uff0c\u5c31\u50cf\u4ed6\u89aa\u8fd1\u666e\u4e01\u4e00\u6a23\u7684\u601d\u7dad\uff0c\u70cf\u514b\u862d\uff0c\u53ea\u662f\u4ed6\u624b\u4e0a\u7684\u724c\u800c\u5df1\uff0c\u53f0\u7063\u4e5f\u6c92\u4ec0\u9ebc\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\n\nHe [Trump] is changing the definition of trust and peace into the law of the jungle, which is very unfavorable to the survival of small countries. Our military strength is incomparable with China's. When Taiwan has trouble, Trump will not stand up for justice. He only wants TSMC, just like he only wants Ukraine's rare minerals.\n\nOne day, when we need his help, Taiwan would be the one being humiliated and bullied. Trump has chosen isolationism and will not invest more troops and spendings to maintain the first island chain in the Asia-Pacific. Making friends with China will save all the money. Such rationality is reflected in his relationship with Putin. Ukraine is just a card he plays, and Taiwan is no different.\n\nIn the past few years, pro-Taiwan status quo politicians and activists have used the slogan \u201cToday\u2019s Ukraine, Tomorrow Taiwan\u201d to unite Taiwanese people in the face of China's military threats. After Trump's attack on Zelensky, the same slogan spread\u00a0doubt about America and anxiety about Taiwan's future.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMeanwhile, Taiwan\u2019s pro-Chinese politicians, including former Taiwan President and KMT leader Ma Ying-jeou, took the opportunity to criticise the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and Lai\u2019s leadership:\n\n3\/7 Former Taiwan President Ying-jeou Ma called for the current administration to protect TSMC due to its great importance in national security and asked, \u2018is selling TSMC is enough?\u2019 and \u2018what else is left to sell later?\u2019 $TSM #semiconductors https:\/\/t.co\/O0sLF4cAtQ\n\n\u2014 Dan Nystedt (@dnystedt) March 5, 2025\n\nWritten by Oiwan Lam\n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

The patent' s inventors are Chiang, Kuo-Cheng, Chu, Lung-Kun, Hsu, Chung-Wei, Huang, Mao-Lin, Wang, Chih-Hao, Yu, Jia-Ni. 2025 MAR 13 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Daily Asia Business -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (Hsinchu, Taiwan) has been issued patent number 12237396, according to news reporting originating out of Alexandria, Virginia, by NewsRx editors.\n\nThe patent's inventors are Chiang, Kuo-Cheng (Hsinchu, TW), Chu, Lung-Kun (New Taipei, TW), Hsu, Chung-Wei (Hsinchu, TW), Huang, Mao-Lin (Hsinchu, TW), Wang, Chih-Hao (Hsinchu, TW), Yu, Jia-Ni (New Taipei, TW).\n\nThis patent was filed on July 26, 2022 and was published online on February 25, 2025.\n\nFrom the background information supplied by the inventors, news correspondents obtained the following quote: \"The electronics industry has experienced an ever-increasing demand for smaller and faster electronic devices that are simultaneously able to support a greater number of increasingly complex and sophisticated functions. To meet these demands, there is a continuing trend in the integrated circuit (IC) industry to manufacture low-cost, high-performance, and low-power ICs. Thus far, these goals have been achieved in large part by reducing IC dimensions (for example, minimum IC feature size), thereby improving production efficiency and lowering associated costs. However, such scaling has also increased complexity of the IC manufacturing processes. Thus, realizing continued advances in IC devices and their performance requires similar advances in IC manufacturing processes and technology.\n\n\"Recently, multigate devices have been introduced to improve gate control. Multigate devices have been observed to increase gate-channel coupling, reduce OFF-state current, and\/or reduce short-channel effects (SCEs). One such multigate device is the gate-all around (GAA) device, which includes a gate structure that can extend, partially or fully, around a channel region to provide access to the channel region on at least two sides. GAA devices enable aggressive scaling down of IC technologies, maintaining gate control and mitigating SCEs, while seamlessly integrating with conventional IC manufacturing processes. As GAA devices continue to scale, challenges have arisen when fabricating a gate structure for a GAA device that includes an n-metal gate that shares a boundary with a p-metal gate, which challenges have been observed to degrade GAA device performance and increase GAA processing complexity. Accordingly, although existing GAA devices and methods for fabricating such have been generally adequate for their intended purposes, they have not been entirely satisfactory in all respects.\"\n\nSupplementing the background information on this patent, NewsRx reporters also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: \"The present disclosure relates generally to integrated circuit devices, and more particularly, to multigate devices, such as gate-all-around (GAA) devices.\n\n\"The following disclosure provides many different embodiments, or examples, for implementing different features.

Moreover, the formation of a feature on, connected to, and\/or coupled to another feature in the present disclosure may include embodiments in which the features are formed in direct contact, and may also include embodiments in which additional features may be formed interposing the features, such that the features may not be in direct contact.\n\n\"Further, spatially relative terms, for example, \"lower,\" \"upper,\" \"horizontal,\" \"vertical,\" \"above,\" \"over,\" \"below,\" \"beneath,\" \"up,\" \"down,\" \"top,\" \"bottom,\" etc. as well as derivatives thereof (e.g., \"horizontally,\" \"downwardly,\" \"upwardly,\" etc.) are used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s).

Technological advances in IC materials and design have produced generations of ICs where each generation has smaller and more complex circuits than the previous generation. However, these advances have increased the complexity of processing and manufacturing ICs and, for these advances to be realized, similar developments in IC processing and manufacturing are needed. In the course of IC evolution, functional density (i.e., the number of interconnected devices per chip area) has generally increased while geometry size (i.e., the smallest component that can be created using a fabrication process) has decreased.\n\n\"The decreased geometry sizes lead to challenges in semiconductor fabrication. For example, as geometry sizes continue to decrease, loading (e.g., due to components having different sizes) may become a concern. For example, loading issues could lead to excessive loss of a gate height of a transistor. When this occurs, the result is degraded device performance or even device failures.\n\n\"Therefore, while existing semiconductor devices and the fabrication thereof have been generally adequate for their intended purposes, they have not been entirely satisfactory in every aspect.\"\n\nSupplementing the background information on this patent, NewsRx reporters also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: \"It is understood that the following disclosure provides many different embodiments, or examples, for implementing different features of the present disclosure. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. For example, the formation of a first feature over or on a second feature in the description that follows may include embodiments in which the first and second features are formed in direct contact, and may also include embodiments in which additional features may be formed between the first and second features, such that the first and second features may not be in direct contact. In addition, the present disclosure may repeat reference numerals and\/or letters in the various examples. This repetition is for the sake of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and\/or configurations discussed. Moreover, various features may be arbitrarily drawn in different scales for the sake of simplicity and clarity.\n\n\"Further, spatially relative terms, such as \"beneath,\" \"below,\" \"lower,\" \"above,\" \"upper\" and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. The spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, elements described as being \"below\" or \"beneath\" other elements or features would then be oriented \"above\" the other elements or features. Thus, the exemplary term \"below\" can encompass both an orientation of above and below. The apparatus may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein may likewise be interpreted accordingly.\n\n\"Still further, when a number or a range of numbers is described with \"about,\" \"approximate,\" and the like, the term is intended to encompass numbers that are within a reasonable range including the number described, such as within +\/-10% of the number described or other values as understood by person skilled in the art. For example, the term \"about 5 nm\" encompasses the dimension range from 4.5 nm to 5.5 nm.\n\n\"The present disclosure is directed to, but not otherwise limited to, a method to perform semiconductor fabrication, for example an aspect of semiconductor fabrication pertaining to metal gate electrode formation. To illustrate the various aspects of the present disclosure, a FinFET fabrication process is discussed below as a non-limiting example. In that regard, a FinFET device is a fin-like field-effect transistor device, which has been gaining popularity in the semiconductor industry. The FinFET device may be a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) device including a P-type metal-oxide-semiconductor (PMOS) FinFET device and an N-type metal-oxide-semiconductor (NMOS) FinFET device. The following disclosure will continue with one or more FinFET examples to illustrate various embodiments of the present disclosure, but it is understood that the application is not limited to the FinFET device, except as specifically claimed.

(Hsinchu, Taiwan) has been issued patent number 12237404, according to news reporting originating out of Alexandria, Virginia, by NewsRx editors.\n\nThe patent's inventors are Chen, Chien-Hung (Hsinchu, TW), Hsiao, Wen-Chu (Tainan, TW), Lin, Che-Yu (Hsinchu, TW).\n\nThis patent was filed on June 16, 2023 and was published online on February 25, 2025.\n\nFrom the background information supplied by the inventors, news correspondents obtained the following quote: \"Semiconductor devices are used in a variety of electronic applications, such as, for example, personal computers, cell phones, digital cameras, and other electronic equipment. Semiconductor devices are typically fabricated by sequentially depositing insulating or dielectric layers, conductive layers, and semiconductor layers of material over a semiconductor substrate, and patterning the various material layers using lithography to form circuit components and elements thereon.\n\n\"The semiconductor industry continues to improve the integration density of various electronic components (e.g., transistors, diodes, resistors, capacitors, etc.) by continual reductions in minimum feature size, which allow more components to be integrated into a given area. However, as the minimum features sizes are reduced, additional problems arise that should be addressed.\"\n\nSupplementing the background information on this patent, NewsRx reporters also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: \"The following disclosure provides many different embodiments, or examples, for implementing different features of the invention. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. For example, the formation of a first feature over or on a second feature in the description that follows may include embodiments in which the first and second features are formed in direct contact, and may also include embodiments in which additional features may be formed between the first and second features, such that the first and second features may not be in direct contact. In addition, the present disclosure may repeat reference numerals and\/or letters in the various examples. This repetition is for the purpose of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and\/or configurations discussed.\n\n\"Further, spatially relative terms, such as \"beneath,\" \"below,\" \"lower,\" \"above,\" \"upper\" and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. The spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. The apparatus may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein may likewise be interpreted accordingly.\n\n\"According to some embodiments, a substrate of a first semiconductor material (e.g., silicon) is provided, and a layer of a second semiconductor material (e.g., silicon germanium) is formed on the substrate. The second semiconductor material may have a low germanium concentration. Trenches are etched to form fins from the first and second semiconductor materials. A germanium condensation process is performed, which includes exposing the first and second semiconductor materials of the fins to a hydrogen radical. During the germanium condensation process, the germanium concentration along the sidewalls of the fins is increased. By condensing the germanium along the sidewalls of the fins, the germanium concentration in the channel regions of the fins may be increased. Because the fins are initially formed with a low germanium concentration, they have a lower amount of compressive strain, and thus deformation of the fins during trench etching may be reduced.\"\n\nThe claims supplied by the inventors are:\n\n\"1. A method comprising: forming a fin that protrudes from a substrate, a top portion of the fin comprising a first semiconductor material, wherein a bottom portion of the fin and the substrate comprise a second semiconductor material different from the first semiconductor material; and exposing a top surface and sidewalls of the top portion of the fin to a hydrogen plasma, wherein after exposing the top surface and the sidewalls of the top portion of the fin to the hydrogen plasma, a germanium concentration increases in a direction extending from a center portion of the top portion of the fin to edge portions of the top portion of the fin.\n\n\"2.

        "Story":"TSMC Proposes Joint Venture With U.S. Chipmakers to Operate Intel FoundriesMar 13, 2025\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM, Financials) proposed a joint venture with Nvidia (NVDA, Financials), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD, Financials), and Broadcom (AVGO, Financials) to operate Intel's (INTC, Financials) semiconductor foundries, according to industry sources, Reuters said. Qualcomm (QCOM, Financials) has also received the proposal.\n\nThe talks are still in their early stages, hence TSMC would only own a 50% share in the business. Originally supported by the Trump administration, the plan followed a request from the U.S. government to enlist TSMC in Intel's recovery activities. Any arrangement would need for U.S. regulatory clearance given worries about foreign control of Intel's production operations.\n\nIntel's foundry segment has battled to match TSMC and Samsung. Intel evaluated its foundry assets at $108 billion and recorded a $18.8 billion financial loss in 2024\u2014its first since 1986. Notwithstanding many takeover requests, the corporation has opposed requests to split its design division from its foundry activities.\n\nPreviously pledging a $100 billion investment in U.S. semiconductor production with five new manufacturing facilities, TSMC Though some executives still object, certain Intel board members have shown support for the joint venture.\n\nStill a major factor are operational and technical issues. Different production techniques, chemicals, and tooling configurations used by Intel and TSMC might impede their working together. Under consideration by Nvidia, Broadcom, and AMD as they evaluate possible production with Intel, Intel says their 18A manufacturing process is better than TSMC's 2-nanometer technology.\n\nGiven U.S.-China trade tensions and Taiwan's important involvement in chip production, a cooperation between Intel and TSMC might have major effects on the worldwide semiconductor supply chain.\n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Il calo sta coinvolgendo molti titoli taiwanesi, provocando il peggior sell-off di sempre da parte degli investitori stranieri.\n\nIl fornitore chiave di Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) e Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ha perso oltre il 12% del valore delle azioni da inizio anno nel mercato statunitense.\n\nTSMC, che rappresenta oltre un terzo del peso del benchmark di Taiwan, \u00e8 scesa di quasi il 10% a causa della vendita di 155 milioni di azioni da parte di investitori stranieri. I fondi globali hanno ridotto le partecipazioni nelle ultime 12 sessioni, scaricando 391 miliardi di nuovi dollari taiwanesi (11,9 miliardi di dollari) di titoli taiwanesi fino a mercoled\u00ec, come riporta Bloomberg nella sua raccolta dati.\n\nIl presidente e amministratore delegato di TSMC, C.C. Wei, ha recentemente sottolineato che il suo ultimo piano di investimenti da 100 miliardi di dollari (oltre ai 65 miliardi gi\u00e0 impegnati) deriva dalla domanda dei clienti per i suoi chip, che sono fondamentali per alimentare qualsiasi cosa, dai pi\u00f9 recenti sistemi di intelligenza artificiale agli smartphone.\n\nWei ha anche sottolineato che il produttore di chip rimane impegnato nel suo obiettivo di costruire 11 linee di produzione a Taiwan nel 2025.\n\nPer contestualizzare, sin dalla sua campagna presidenziale, il Presidente Donald Trump ha criticato il quasi predominio di Taiwan nella produzione di chip avanzati e ha minacciato dazi sulle importazioni di chip.\n\nGli analisti di HSBC hanno dichiarato a Bloomberg che la frenesia dell'IA, la volatilit\u00e0 del mercato e l'incertezza hanno spinto gli investitori a spostare l'attenzione verso il settore non tecnologico. L'emergere della startup cinese DeepSeek, che sostiene di creare modelli di IA a una frazione del costo dei rivali, ha aumentato l'ansia degli investitori. Il rilascio di modelli di intelligenza artificiale da parte di DeepSeek ha alimentato un crollo del capitale di mercato di 1.000 miliardi di dollari. Nvidia ha perso 600 miliardi di dollari di market cap in un solo giorno.\n\nPrezzo delle azioni TSM\n\nIl titolo TSM \u00e8 in calo del 2,68% a 172,43 dollari nel momento in cui scriviamo.\n\nPer ulteriori aggiornamenti su questo argomento, aggiungi Benzinga Italia ai tuoi preferiti oppure seguici sui nostri canali social: X e Facebook.\n\nRicevi informazioni esclusive sui movimenti di mercato 30 minuti prima degli altri trader\n\nLa prova gratuita di 14 giorni di Benzinga Pro, disponibile solo in inglese, ti permette di accedere ad informazioni esclusive per poter ricevere segnali di trading utilizzabili prima di milioni di altri trader.

        "Story":"My View: Why Amkor is crucial to America and Arizona's economic futureEarlier this month, TSMC, the world's most advanced chipmaker, joined President Donald Trump in the Oval Office to announce it will invest at least $100 billion in Arizona [https:\/\/www.bizjournals.com\/phoenix\/news\/2025\/03\/05\/what-tsmc-expansion-means-for-arizonas-growth.html] , on top of the company's $65 billion already invested in our state, creating tens of thousands of jobs and making it the largest foreign direct investment ever.\n\nTSMC's historic announcement will help ensure that the world's most powerful AI chips are made right here in America \u2013 and Arizona to be more specific.\n\nDuring the announcement, President Trump said: \"We must be able to build the chips and semiconductors that we need right here, with American factories, and American skill, and American labor \u2013 and that's exactly what we're doing.\"\n\nCrucial to this vision is Tempe-based Amkor Technology and its $2 billion factory coming to Peoria [https:\/\/www.bizjournals.com\/phoenix\/news\/2024\/12\/20\/white-house-finalize-amkor-chips-arizona.html] . Chipmaking is a complex process that involves many steps. In past decades, much of this process was outsourced around the globe, especially the last step, known as packaging and testing, creating dangerous supply chain vulnerabilities for the world's most important technology.\n\nToday, practically all semiconductor packaging and testing is done in Asia \u2013 almost none of it in the U.S. If we want to change that, we need Amkor.\n\nAmkor is the only U.S.-headquartered company providing outsourced semiconductor assembly and test services in high-volume production. They've selected Arizona for their groundbreaking facility, which will deliver packaging and testing technology for the most advanced semiconductor chips, including those made nearby by TSMC.\n\nAmkor's sizeable investment further anchors Arizona as the epicenter of advanced packaging technology in North America, adding to Intel's long-standing leadership [https:\/\/www.intc.com\/news-events\/press-releases\/detail\/1647\/intel-unveils-industry-leading-glass-substrates-to-meet] , Arizona's recent selection as the site of the flagship Prototyping and Advanced Packaging R&D facility in Tempe [https:\/\/www.bizjournals.com\/phoenix\/news\/2025\/01\/16\/asu-chips-act-funding.html] , as well as TSMC's announcement that it will build two advanced packaging facilities in Phoenix.\n\nWhat's more, this won't be any ordinary facility. It will be highly sophisticated, employing best practices from Amkor's operations around the world. Amkor has worked closely with local, county and state officials in areas such as water use \u2013 which at least 80% will be reclaimed \u2013 air monitoring, noise reduction, safe handling and storage of materials and traffic optimization. Most important, the project aligns closely with the community's long-term vision of offering high-end employment, upscale retail and restaurants, desirable open space, trails, parks and more.\n\nAmkor is key to that vision, serving as a magnet for businesses and community institutions. Estimates show that Amkor's phase 1 operations will support more than 1,000 good-paying jobs for local residents, generating more $134 million in state and local tax revenue, and delivering more than $1 billion in total economic impact over 10 years.\n\nArizona, and the Phoenix area specifically, is well practiced at cultivating rich community amenities alongside our high-tech industry partners. For example, starting in the 1980s, Intel embarked on a similar journey across the Valley. Today, Intel's operations in Chandler include four chipmaking fabs, two more under construction [https:\/\/www.bizjournals.com\/phoenix\/news\/2024\/11\/26\/intel-chips-act-grant.html] , and a host of supporting facilities, including water reclamation and materials-handling infrastructure.\n\nIntel's operations have served as a cornerstone of community development in the East Valley, contributing to new parks, giving back to local schools, catalyzing the development of high-end neighborhoods, bolstering home values, cultivating vibrant small businesses and recreational opportunities and more.\n\nAlongside Intel, these communities are consistently ranked as some of the most family-friendly and kid-friendly in the country, with more than a few of the country's top-ranked schools.\n\nPeople and companies alike choose Arizona because of our strong community institutions, high-tech economy that offers unmatched opportunity, and unbeatable quality of life. This ideal balance has been part of our DNA for decades and will continue to be long into the future.\n\nFrom bolstering critical domestic supply chains, to enhancing Arizona's high-tech industry ecosystem, and anchoring high-quality community growth, Amkor presents a win-win-win for America, Arizona and Peoria.\n\nWe are immensely grateful to Amkor's steadfast commitment to our state and communities and appreciate the strong local partnerships we've built in support of this project across universities, technical training schools, K-12 schools, local government and more.\n\nArizona and Peoria's future is bright, and we look forward with confidence to the exciting opportunities ahead.\n\nSandra Watson is president and CEO of the Arizona Commerce Authority.\n\nDid you find this article useful?

        "Story":"TSMC Proposed A Joint Venture With Intel To Work With U.S. FirmsMar 12, 2025\n\nImage courtesy of\u00a0123rf.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM) has\u00a0reportedly\u00a0proposed a joint venture with Intel (Nasdaq: INTC). This initiative aims to engage major U.S. chip designers such as Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA), AMD (NYSE: AMD), Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO), and Qualcomm (Nasdaq: QCOM).\n\nThe collaboration seeks to rejuvenate Intel\u2019s foundry division by customizing chip production for clients while maintaining less than a 50% stake. The proposal is still in its early stages and requires U.S. government approval, with the Trump administration showing interest in revitalizing Intel to strengthen American manufacturing capabilities.\n\nDespite the promising outlook, the collaboration faces potential hurdles due to differences in manufacturing processes.\n\nTSMC Joint Venture Can Reshape Intel\u2019s Future\n\nIntel is navigating a difficult financial landscape, having reported a\u00a0substantial net loss\u00a0in 2024.

The U.S. government\u2019s involvement reflects the strategic importance of this collaboration, as it aligns with broader goals of enhancing domestic manufacturing and technological capabilities.\n\nOne of the prominent challenges facing the TSMC and Intel collaboration is the disparity in their manufacturing processes and technologies. TSMC, renowned for its advanced fabrication techniques, will need to align its operations with Intel\u2019s existing infrastructure to achieve seamless integration. This endeavor requires careful planning and execution to ensure compatibility and efficiency in production. The success of this venture could set a precedent for future collaborations in the semiconductor industry, fostering innovation and growth despite the technical challenges involved.\n\nNVDA, TSM Stock Brief\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s stock has experienced notable movement, reflecting investor interest and market dynamics. As of March 12, 2025, the stock opened at $114.12 and reached a current price of $115.04, with a day high of $116.76. The company\u2019s market capitalization stands at $2.81 trillion, indicating its significant presence in the industry. NVIDIA\u2019s financial metrics, including a\u00a0trailing P\/E\u00a0of 39.14 and a forward P\/E of 27.93, highlight its growth potential. Analysts have issued a strong buy recommendation for NVIDIA, with a target high price of $220.00, suggesting optimism about the company\u2019s future prospects.\n\nTSMC\u2019s stock performance has also been under scrutiny, with recent price movements reflecting market sentiment. The stock opened at $175.60 on March 12, 2025, and reached a current price of $177.23. With a market cap of $919.21 billion, TSMC remains a dominant player in the semiconductor sector. Key financial metrics, such as a trailing P\/E ratio of 25.72 and a forward P\/E ratio of 21.93, indicate the company\u2019s robust financial health.

        "Headline":"Taiwan Affairs Office slams DPP for 'selling out' Taiwan amid concerns of TSMC becoming USMC in island",
        "Story":"Taiwan Affairs Office slams DPP for 'selling out' Taiwan amid concerns of TSMC becoming USMC in island\n In response to a recent joint announcement by US President Donald Trump and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) CEO C.C. Wei that TSMC will invest at least another $100 billion in the US, sparking concerns on the island that TSMC is turning into \"USMC,\" while DPP authorities claimed that the move benefits the industry and dismissed such concerns as unnecessary, Chen Binhua, a spokesperson of the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, said at a press conference on Wednesday that the DPP's rhetoric is no other than swallowing insults while the lies unravel. The so-called move being \"beneficial to the industry\" actually means beneficial to the US industry. \n\n In an attempt to \"rely on the US to seek independence,\" the DPP authorities are shamelessly \"selling out Taiwan\" with no limits. The US is tightening its grip, hollowing out TSMC and draining Taiwan island, while the DPP authorities allow themselves to be at the mercy of others. Have they ever considered the well-being of the people in Taiwan and the interests of the industry, Chen asked. \n\n Taiwan residents' concerns about TSMC becoming \"USMC\" are far from \"groundless worries.\" Taiwan's transformation from a \"pawn\" to a \"discarded piece\" is inevitable, the spokesperson said. \n\n When responding to a separate question regarding the recent claims by Raymond Greene, director of the American Institute in Taiwan, that what the US does in Taiwan is to \"make Taiwan stronger, safer, and more prosperous\" and the two sides can build a \"non-Chinese supply chain\" in areas such as drones and robotics, Chen slammed the US for talking about \"supporting Taiwan,\" while its actions only \"harm and destroy the island.\" \n\n Chen said pressuring TSMC to invest up to $100 billion in the US to build the world's largest chip industry raises the question of whether this strengthens Taiwan or merely serves US interests. As TSMC increasingly becomes \"USMC,\" the spokesperson questioned how much of Taiwan's industrial edge and economic vitality would be left. \n\n The DPP authorities, out of a mentality of currying favor with the US, blindly meet the demands put forward by the US. This is extremely detrimental to the development of TSMC and is actually a move to hollow out TSMC, Zhang Wensheng, deputy dean of the Taiwan Research Institute at Xiamen University, told the Global Times on Wednesday. \n\n \"The concerns of the people on the island are reasonable. TSMC's huge investment in the US may uproot Taiwan's pillar industries in the economy. Not only TSMC itself, but its entire industrial chain, including technology, capital and technical personnel, may be transferred to the US. This will have a huge impact on the future economic development of the island,\" Zhang said. \n\n Chen also said at the press conference that the DPP authorities' push to decouple Taiwan's trade and industrial ties with the Chinese mainland contradicts economic logic and undermines the interests of people on both sides. \"Such attempts are doomed to fail,\" he said. \n\n Chen pointed to the strong momentum of cross-Straits trade, noting that total trade between the two sides reached $292.97 billion in 2024, a 9.4 percent year-on-year increase. He said that in the first two months of 2025 alone, trade totaled $43.18 billion, an 8.8 percent rise, demonstrating that economic ties remain robust and supply chains resilient. \n\n Statistics on cross-Straits trade show that economic cooperation between the mainland and Taiwan region is strong. Despite the DPP's efforts to sever economic ties with the mainland, Taiwan businesses and entrepreneurs recognize the benefits of the vast market in the mainland, making \"decoupling\" difficult to achieve, Zhang said. \n\n Global Times \n\n\nCopyright Global Times.

This patent was filed on August 30, 2021 and... 2025 MAR 12 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Daily Asia Business -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (Hsinchu, Taiwan) has been issued patent number 12230567, according to news reporting originating out of Alexandria, Virginia, by NewsRx editors.\n\nThe patent's inventors are Lee, Tze-Liang (Hsinchu, TW), Wang, Jen-Hung (Hsinchu County, TW), Wang, Wei-Ren (New Taipei, TW).\n\nThis patent was filed on August 30, 2021 and was published online on February 18, 2025.\n\nFrom the background information supplied by the inventors, news correspondents obtained the following quote: \"In the semiconductor integrated circuit (IC) industry, technological advances in IC materials and design have produced generations of ICs where each generation has smaller and more complex circuits than the previous generation. In the course of IC evolution, functional density (i.e., the number of interconnected devices per chip area) has generally increased as a result of decreasing minimum feature size or geometry sizes (i.e., the smallest component (or line) that can be created using a fabrication process). Such scaling down has also increased the complexity of IC processing and manufacturing.\n\n\"Semiconductor structures are typically formed using multiple layers of material, including conductive and insulating layers. To provide electrical conductivity between layers in a semiconductor structure, a via\/contact may be formed through certain layers.\"\n\nSupplementing the background information on this patent, NewsRx reporters also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: \"The following disclosure provides many different embodiments, or examples, for implementing different features of the provided subject matter. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. For example, the formation of a first feature over or on a second feature in the description that follows may include embodiments in which the first and second features are formed in direct contact, and may also include embodiments in which additional features may be formed between the first and second features, such that the first and second features may not be in direct contact. In addition, the present disclosure may repeat reference numerals and\/or letters in the various examples. This repetition is for the purpose of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and\/or configurations discussed.\n\n\"Further, spatially relative terms, such as \"beneath,\" \"below,\" \"lower,\" \"above,\" \"upper\" and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. The spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. The apparatus may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein may likewise be interpreted accordingly.\n\n\"As used herein, \"around\", \"about\", \"approximately\", or \"substantially\" shall generally mean within 20 percent, or within 10 percent, or within 5 percent of a given value or range. Numerical quantities given herein are approximated, meaning that the term \"around\", \"about\", \"approximately\", or \"substantially\" can be inferred if not expressly stated.\n\n\"Some embodiments of this disclosure relate to a semiconductor structure and more specifically to the semiconductor structure including multiple etch stop layers. Because the etch stop layers are beneficial for conductive vias to be formed aligned with underlying conductive features, contact area between the conductive vias and the conductive features can be increased and thus the overlay shift problem can be improved.\"\n\nThe claims supplied by the inventors are:\n\n\"1. A method, comprising: forming a first conductive feature and a second conductive feature in a dielectric layer; selectively forming a first etch stop layer over the dielectric layer while leaving the first conductive feature and the second conductive feature exposed; forming a capping layer over the first conductive feature; performing a plasma treatment on the capping layer to form a bonding layer between the capping layer and the first conductive feature; forming a second etch stop layer over the first etch stop layer; etching the second etch stop layer to form an opening; and filling a conductive material in the opening to form a conductive via.\n\n\"2.

        "Story":"TSMC, Nvidia, AMD e Broadcom insieme per rilanciare Intel?Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) avrebbe contattato i progettisti di chip statunitensi Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) e Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) per investire in una joint venture (JV).\n\nSecondo un report di Reuters, con la joint venture TSMC intende gestire le fabbriche di Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC).\n\nCosa \u00e8 successo\n\nLa proposta suggerisce che il produttore di chip taiwanese gestirebbe la divisione di fonderia di Intel, che personalizza i chip per i clienti, ma non ne avrebbe pi\u00f9 del 50%, secondo le fonti del report.\n\nTSMC ha contattato anche Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) per questa joint venture, ha aggiunto il report.\n\nLe discussioni sono in fase iniziale e fanno seguito alla richiesta dell'amministrazione Trump di aiutare TSMC a rivitalizzare Intel, un'entit\u00e0 industriale statunitense chiave. I dettagli del piano e i contatti di TSMC con i potenziali partner sono stati riportati per la prima volta.\n\nQualsiasi accordo richiederebbe l'approvazione dell'amministrazione Trump, che si oppone alla piena propriet\u00e0 straniera di Intel o della sua divisione fonderia.\n\nLe azioni di Intel sono crollate di oltre il 56% nell'ultimo anno e l'azienda ha riportato una perdita netta di 18,8 miliardi di dollari nel 2024. Secondo un documento dell'azienda, al 31 dicembre le attivit\u00e0 della divisione fonderia erano valutate 108 miliardi di dollari.\n\nPerch\u00e9 \u00e8 importante\n\nLa proposta di TSMC arriva in un momento in cui l'azienda sta vivendo una crescita significativa, trainata dall'aumento della domanda dei suoi chip utilizzati nelle applicazioni di intelligenza artificiale.\n\nNei primi due mesi del 2025, TSMC ha riportato un aumento delle entrate del 39,2%, evidenziando la forte domanda dei suoi prodotti.\n\nQuesta crescita fa parte di una tendenza pi\u00f9 ampia, poich\u00e9 l'amministratore delegato di TSMC, C. C. Wei, ha sottolineato che l'espansione negli Stati Uniti \u00e8 guidata dal boom dei mercati dell'IA e degli smartphone, non da pressioni politiche.\n\nQuesta espansione comprende un piano di investimenti da 100 miliardi di dollari per soddisfare la crescente domanda dei clienti statunitensi.\n\nInoltre, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ha stretto una partnership con TSMC per produrre il suo primo chip IA interno, con l'obiettivo di ridurre la dipendenza da fornitori come Nvidia.\n\nQuesta mossa sottolinea la crescente importanza di TSMC nel mercato dei chip IA. Nel frattempo, il CEO di Broadcom, Hock Tan, ha respinto le speculazioni su una potenziale fusione con Intel.\n\nBenzinga ha contattato TSMC, Nvidia, Intel, Broadcom e Qualcomm per ulteriori commenti.

        "Headline":"Intel's $18.8B Meltdown:Can a TSMC Rescue Deal Save the Chip Giant?",
        "Story":"Intel's $18.8B Meltdown:Can a TSMC Rescue Deal Save the Chip Giant?Mar 12, 2025\n\nIntel (INTC, Financial) is weighing a major shake-up as it explores handing off its struggling foundry division to a joint venture led by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM, Financial). TSMC reportedly pitched Nvidia (NVDA, Financial), AMD (AMD, Financial), Broadcom (AVGO, Financial), and Qualcomm (QCOM, Financial) on taking stakes in the business, with TSMC keeping its ownership below 50 percent. The move, reportedly encouraged by the Trump administration, comes as Intel tries to recover from a brutal $18.8 billion net loss in 2024\u2014its first since 1986. While Intel's board supports the talks, internal pushback and operational hurdles could complicate the deal, with U.S. regulators likely playing a decisive role in the outcome.\n\nTSMC isn't just making a play for Intel's foundry\u2014it's doubling down on its U.S. presence, rolling out a fresh $100 billion investment in domestic chip production. Meanwhile, Nvidia and Broadcom are already testing Intel's cutting-edge 18A process, with AMD still on the fence. But tensions are brewing, with Intel claiming its 18A tech beats TSMC's 2-nanometer process. Beyond that, the companies use vastly different manufacturing setups, making any integration a costly, technically complex challenge. Some Intel execs are wary of the deal, and sources say Qualcomm, once a potential buyer, has already walked away from talks.\n\nWith Intel's stock under pressure and the company rejecting piecemeal sales of its design unit, all eyes are on whether this deal will stick. Trump is pushing for stronger domestic chipmaking, and any agreement will need Washington's blessing. If this joint venture materializes, it could mark a turning point for Intel, reshaping the U.S. semiconductor landscape in the process.\n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

        "Headline":"Samsung begins mass production of 4nm chips\u2014can it win Qualcomm back?",
        "Story":"Samsung begins mass production of 4nm chips\u2014can it win Qualcomm back?Mar 12, 2025\n\nSamsung is back in the game, and TSMC\u2019s got competition. According to ZDNet Korea, the company is\u00a0finally kicking off mass production of its 4nm chipsets after struggling with low yields. This marks a major turnaround for the Samsung Foundry business. But the real question is, can Samsung now win back clients like Qualcomm and Google?\n\nSamsung was one of the first to introduce 4nm chips. However, early versions suffered from low yields and power inefficiency. That led major customers like Qualcomm to jump ship. For example, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, built on Samsung\u2019s first-gen 4nm process, had poor thermal efficiency. As a result, Qualcomm moved the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 and Gen 2 to TSMC\u2019s 4nm node.\n\nMass production of 4nm chips\n\nThe company\u2019s latest fourth-generation 4nm process node (SF4X) is said to be a big improvement, which is why Samsung is confident enough to begin mass production on it. Yield rates have increased, making production more cost-effective. SF4X also features Back-End-of-Line (BEOL) wiring technology, which enhances power efficiency and performance.\n\nApparently, this process boosts chip density and reduces power consumption, but we\u2019ll have to wait for real-world tests to decide if it can truly compete with TSMC\u2019s 4nm chips.\n\nThis progress also means Samsung\u2019s mass production of 4nm is now stable. That could attract companies looking to diversify their foundry partners. Qualcomm, which relies heavily on TSMC, might consider splitting orders between the two foundries.\n\nGoogle is reportedly turning to TSMC for its Tensor G5 in the Pixel 10. However, if Samsung\u2019s yields and chips live up to its claims, maybe Google could return for future Tensor chipsets.\n\nSamsung is competitive again\n\nThe focus on technology is always on the latest and greatest tech. Right now, more companies are turning to TSMC\u2019s 3nm process to produce its chipsets. Apple\u2019s A17 Pro and Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 8 Elite are some of the commercially available chipsets that are built on TSMC\u2019s 3nm process.\n\nHowever, this doesn\u2019t mean that 4nm should be forgotten and discarded. There is still a lot of use for the 4nm process. Companies that want to make more affordable phones use lower-end chipsets. These chipsets can benefit from the 4nm process. If Samsung\u2019s 4nm process is truly improved and has better yield and energy efficiency, the company could focus on volume by producing chipsets for other companies like MediaTek. It could also convince Qualcomm to return for its Snapdragon 7 series.\n\nThe post Samsung begins mass production of 4nm chips\u2014can it win Qualcomm back? appeared first on Android Headlines.\n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

        "Headline":"Taiwan Semiconductor Doubles Down On US Investment, Putting Pressure On Intel",
        "Story":"Taiwan Semiconductor Doubles Down On US Investment, Putting Pressure On IntelTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has announced a staggering USD 100 billion investment in the United States, significantly expanding its presence with new fabrication plants, packaging factories and a research and development (R&D) center. The move comes as Intel faces mounting challenges, including delays in its Ohio plant, raising concerns about its ability to compete in the global foundry market.\n\nTSMC's latest investment builds on its existing USD 65 billion project in Arizona, reinforcing its commitment to strengthening operational ties with major semiconductor clients such as Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom and Qualcomm.\n\nMeanwhile, Intel's foundry business continues to struggle. In 2024, Intel Foundry reported USD 17.5 billion in revenue, marking a 7 per cent decline from the previous year. The company, once a leader in the semiconductor industry, now finds itself trailing behind TSMC, which controls nearly 60 per cent of the global foundry market. Adding to Intel's woes, the company recently announced a delay in the opening of its Ohio manufacturing plant. Initially scheduled to be operational between 2024 and 2026, the project has now been pushed to 2030, raising further doubts about Intel's ability to meet rising demand.\n\nThe expansion of TSMC's manufacturing footprint in the US could reshape the domestic semiconductor industry. The AI boom has led many to believe that Intel would emerge as a key beneficiary of increasing capital expenditures by major tech firms. However, TSMC's strategic investments appear to have solidified its lead, potentially marginalising Intel in the competition for US-based semiconductor production.\n\nIn 2022, President Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act, a landmark USD 280 billion initiative aimed at boosting semiconductor manufacturing and research in the US Intel was expected to be a major beneficiary of the act, receiving government support to expand its foundry business. However, despite these investments, Intel has yet to show significant progress in catching up with its rivals.\n\nIndustry analysts have speculated that Intel could regain momentum through a partnership with TSMC. While there have been discussions about potential collaborations, no concrete details have emerged so far. Some even suggest that a strategic alliance or acquisition could be the best outcome for Intel as it struggles to compete with its dominant rival.\n\nCopyright 2025 BW Businessworld Media Pvt Ltd, distributed by Contify.com"

        "Story":"TSMC Proposes Joint Venture With Nvidia, AMD And Broadcom To Operate Intel's Factories: ReportTaiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) has approached U.S. chip designers Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) to invest in a joint venture (JV), according to a report on Wednesday.\n\nWhat Happened: With the joint venture, TSMC aims to operate Intel Corp.'s (NASDAQ:INTC) factories, according to a report by Reuters.\n\nThe proposal suggests that the Taiwanese chipmaker would manage Intel's foundry division, which customizes chips for clients, but would not own more than 50%, according to sources in the report.\n\nTSMC has also approached Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) for this JV, the report added.\n\nSEE ALSO: Elon Musk Says Tesla Will Double US Production in 2 Years After Trump Backs EV Giant Amid Stock Slump\n\nThe discussions are in early stages and follow a request from the Trump administration for TSMC to aid in revitalizing Intel, a key U.S. industrial entity. The plan details and TSMC's outreach to potential partners are being reported for the first time.\n\nAny agreement would require approval from the Trump administration, which opposes full foreign ownership of Intel or its foundry division\n\nSubscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox.\n\nIntel's shares have plummeted over 56% in the past year, and the company reported a net loss of $18.8 billion in 2024. The foundry division's assets were valued at $108 billion as of December 31, according to a company filing.\n\nWhy It Matters: The proposal from TSMC comes at a time when the company is experiencing significant growth, driven by a surge in demand for its chips used in artificial intelligence applications.\n\nIn the first two months of 2025, TSMC reported a 39.2% increase in revenue, highlighting the robust demand for its products.\n\nThis growth is part of a broader trend, as TSMC's CEO, C. C. Wei, emphasised that their U.S. expansion is driven by the booming AI and smartphone markets, not political pressure.\n\nThis expansion includes a $100 billion investment plan to meet the rising demand from U.S. customers.\n\nAdditionally, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has partnered with TSMC to produce its first in-house AI chip, aiming to reduce dependence on suppliers like Nvidia.\n\nThis move underscores the growing importance of TSMC in the AI chip market. Meanwhile, Broadcom's CEO, Hock Tan, has dismissed speculation about a potential merger with Intel.\n\nBenzinga has reached out to TSMC, Nvidia, Intel, Broadcom and Qualcomm for comments. This story will be updated as and when they respond.\n\nCheck out more of Benzinga's Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.\n\nRead Next:\n\nElon Musk's SpaceX Inks Agreements With India's Top Telecom Providers For Starlink, Expanding Access To 850 Million Users\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto courtesy: Shutterstock\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga | All Rights Reserved Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

TSMC is discussing a jv to take over Intel Foundry with Nvidia, Broadcom, Qualcomm and AMD, according to Reuters.\n\nUnder the plan, TSMC would take a stake of not more than 50% in Intel Foundry in order to keep the company US-owned which is a requirement set by the White House.\n\nIt is said that TSMC would like to have more than one partner in the jv.\n\nThe Reuters report says that the talks began before TSMC announced its latest $100 billion investment in Arizona, but have continued after the announcement of that investment last weekend.\n\nAny deal will need White House approval.\n\nYesterday,  Broadcom CEO Hock Tan was asked whether he would take over Intel's design operation and replied: \"M&A? No. I'm too busy \u2013 we're too busy doing AI and VMware  at this point\", which  suggests that Tan  is not up for another big  acquisition at the moment.\n\nThe post TSMC discussing Intel jv, reports Reuters [https:\/\/www.electronicsweekly.com\/news\/business\/tsmc-discussing-intel-jv-reports-reuters-2025-03\/] appeared first on Electronics Weekly [https:\/\/www.electronicsweekly.com] ."

Under this proposal, TSMC would manage Intel's wafer division but would hold less than a 50% stake. Qualcomm was also approached with a similar proposal.\n\nAny final agreement would require approval from the U.S. government.

        "Story":"TSMC's Dresden chip plant not affected by German strikeGermany's second largest trade union, Ver.di, called for a nationwide strike on Monday involving public sector workers affecting 13 airports, sanitation, hospitals, and other industries.\n\nAccording to German broadcaster Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk, TSMC's German chip factory construction is proceeding normally. The size of the chip fab is the equivalent of 40 soccer fields, with two-thirds of earth excavation nearing completion, and will be ready to welcome 1,000 construction workers, per CNA.\n\nThe TSMC project is a joint venture involving Bosch, Infineon, and NXP. A groundbreaking ceremony was held in August in an area outside Dresden, Germany, called Silicon Saxony. The facility is expected to be completed and begin production in 2027.\n\nAccording to MDR, a 24-hour shift system is being used to carry out 500,000 cubic meters of earthwork. Steffen Muller, head of infrastructure and plant management at the joint venture, told German media that the foundation slab pouring work will be completed in the next few weeks.\n\nMuller said the next challenge will be \"logistics and scheduling\" as the plant is composed of more than 30,000 prefabricated building components. This means that factory components need to be delivered to the right location at the right time.\n\nA dedicated access road to the site will be built to ensure smooth logistics. The road not only ensures smooth delivery of oversized construction materials to the site but also avoids disrupting existing traffic in Silicon Saxony.\n\nIn April, a concrete plant will be built on-site to ensure a stable supply of concrete during construction. A site office and a staff restaurant are currently being built to accommodate 1,000 construction workers per day in the next phase of construction."

(Hsinchu, Taiwan) has been issued patent number 12232334, according to news reporting originating out of Alexandria, Virginia, by NewsRx editors.\n\nThe patent's inventors are Huang, Chia-En (Xinfeng Township, TW), Lin, Meng-Han (Hsinchu, TW).\n\nThis patent was filed on November 21, 2023 and was published online on February 18, 2025.\n\nFrom the background information supplied by the inventors, news correspondents obtained the following quote: \"The semiconductor industry has experienced rapid growth due to continuous improvements in the integration density of a variety of electronic components (e.g., transistors, diodes, resistors, capacitors, etc.). For the most part, this improvement in integration density has come from repeated reductions in minimum feature size, which allows more components to be integrated into a given area.\"\n\nSupplementing the background information on this patent, NewsRx reporters also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: \"The following disclosure provides many different embodiments, or examples, for implementing different features of the provided subject matter. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. For example, the formation of a first feature over, or on a second feature in the description that follows may include embodiments in which the first and second features are formed in direct contact, and may also include embodiments in which additional features may be formed between the first and second features, such that the first and second features may not be in direct contact. In addition, the present disclosure may repeat reference numerals and\/or letters in the various examples. This repetition is for the purpose of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and\/or configurations discussed.\n\n\"Further, spatially relative terms, such as \"beneath,\" \"below,\" \"lower,\" \"above,\" \"upper\" \"top,\" \"bottom\" and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. The spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. The apparatus may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein may likewise be interpreted accordingly.\n\n\"High-k Metal Gate (HKMG) transistor structures are widely used in advanced Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) technologies thanks to their immunity from poly gate depletion issues and substantially low gate coupling capacitance. In particular, fabricating such HKMG transistors on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates makes it a promising candidate for the next generation wireless communication (e.g., 5G) applications. However, such SOI-based HKMG transistors are typically configured for low-voltage applications (e.g., operating under less than about 1 volt (V)). In order to integrate these HKMG transistors with other devices, configured for some high-voltage applications (e.g., operating with more than about 2V), on a same SOI substrate, various issues may arise. For example, when fabricating the similar HKMG structures for the low-voltage and high-voltage applications, the HKMG structure of a high-voltage transistor, typically formed in a longer length and wider width, suffers from a dishing effect resulting from a polishing process. Even fabricating the HKMG structure of the high-voltage transistor by replacing an upper layer of the SOI substrate, the dishing effect still remains over an interlayer dielectric over the high-voltage transistor. This dishing effect is generally undesirable in the CMOS fabrication. Thus, the existing SOI-based HKMG transistors have not been entirely satisfactory in many aspects.\n\n\"The present disclosure provides various embodiments of a semiconductor device that includes a low-voltage device portion and a high-voltage device portion formed on a single silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate. In the low-voltage device portion, each transistor (low-voltage transistor) may have a HKMG structure, while in the high-voltage device portion, each transistor (high-voltage transistor) may have a plural number of HKMG structures concurrently formed with the HKMG structure of the low-voltage transistor. According to various embodiments of the present disclosure, these HKMG structures of the high-voltage transistor may function as dummy gate structures. For example, instead of electrically gating the high-voltage transistor, a number of poly gate structures, which are replaced by these dummy HKMG structures, may serve as resistant pillars to prevent a dishing effect from being incurred in a polishing process that is desirable for concurrently forming the HKMG structures for the low-voltage and high-voltage transistors, respectively. With such a high-voltage transistor integrated on the same substrate, the semiconductor device, as disclosed herein, can integrate more other types of devices therein. For example, a memory array may be formed to operatively couple to a number of the high voltage transistors. Memory components of the memory array can thus be operated under a relatively high voltage such as, for example, resistive random access memory (RRAM) resistors.\"\n\nThe claims supplied by the inventors are:\n\n\"1.

(Hsinchu, Taiwan) has been issued patent number 12230634, according to news reporting originating out of Alexandria, Virginia, by NewsRx editors.\n\nThe patent's inventors are Lee, Tsung-Lin (Hsinchu, TW), Li, Ming-Shuan (Hsinchu County, TW), Yeh, Chih Chieh (Taipei, TW).\n\nThis patent was filed on September 2, 2021 and was published online on February 18, 2025.\n\nFrom the background information supplied by the inventors, news correspondents obtained the following quote: \"The semiconductor integrated circuit (IC) industry has experienced exponential growth. Technological advances in IC materials and design have produced generations of ICs where each generation has smaller and more complex circuits than the previous generation. In the course of IC evolution, functional density (i.e., the number of interconnected devices per chip area) has generally increased while geometry size (i.e., the smallest component (or line) that can be created using a fabrication process) has decreased. This scaling down process generally provides benefits by increasing production efficiency and lowering associated costs. Such scaling down has also increased the complexity of processing and manufacturing ICs.\n\n\"For example, as semiconductor devices continue to scale, challenges arise in achieving desired density and performance. The desired density and performance also demand effective and precise etching process. However, due to densely spaced features and reduced process windows, some sacrificial features may not be substantially removed in a predetermined etching duration and some residues may remain, preventing satisfactory formation of functional structures, such as gate structures. While over-etching may reduce undesirable residual sacrificial features, adjacent features may suffer damages. Accordingly, although existing devices and methods for fabricating such have been generally adequate for their intended purposes, they have not been entirely satisfactory in all respects.\"\n\nSupplementing the background information on this patent, NewsRx reporters also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: \"The following disclosure provides many different embodiments, or examples, for implementing different features of the provided subject matter. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. For example, the formation of a first feature over or on a second feature in the description that follows may include embodiments in which the first and second features are formed in direct contact, and may also include embodiments in which additional features may be formed between the first and second features, such that the first and second features may not be in direct contact. In addition, the present disclosure may repeat reference numerals and\/or letters in the various examples. This repetition is for the purpose of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and\/or configurations discussed.\n\n\"Spatially relative terms, such as \"beneath,\" \"below,\" \"lower,\" \"above,\" \"upper\" and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. The spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. The apparatus may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein may likewise be interpreted accordingly.\n\n\"Further, when a number or a range of numbers is described with \"about,\" \"approximate,\" and the like, the term is intended to encompass numbers that are within a reasonable range considering variations that inherently arise during manufacturing as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, the number or range of numbers encompasses a reasonable range including the number described, such as within +\/-10% of the number described, based on known manufacturing tolerances associated with manufacturing a feature having a characteristic associated with the number. For example, a material layer having a thickness of \"about 5 nm\" can encompass a dimension range from 4.25 nm to 5.75 nm where manufacturing tolerances associated with depositing the material layer are known to be +\/-15% by one of ordinary skill in the art. Still further, the present disclosure may repeat reference numerals and\/or letters in the various examples. This repetition is for the purpose of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and\/or configurations discussed.\n\n\"Multi-gate devices, such as a multi-bridge-channel (MBC) transistor (also known as a gate-all-around (GAA) transistor, a nanosheet transistor, a nanowire transistor, or a surrounding gate transistor (SGT)), have been introduced to improve gate control by increasing gate-channel coupling, reducing off-state current, and reducing short-channel effects (SCEs). Formation of an MBC transistor includes formation of a stack that includes a number of channel layers interleaved by a number of sacrificial layers, where the sacrificial layers may be selectively removed to release the channel layers as channel members. A gate structure, which includes multiple dielectric and conductive layers, is then formed to wrap around each of the channel members. As described above, aggressive scaling down of IC dimensions has resulted in densely spaced features. For example, the dimensions of each stack and the space between two adjacent stacks are reduced. Due to the densely spaced features, an etching window for removing the sacrificial layers is also reduced, leading to a portion of the sacrificial layers remain in the channel region (e.g., residues) after the channel release process. The residues of the sacrificial layers may disadvantageously prevent the gate structure from being formed around some of the bottom channel members, thereby leading to a non-uniform gate control and thus unsatisfactory device performance. Without changing the footprint of the device and without affecting the electrical isolation between two adjacent transistors, one possible method of substantially avoiding such residue may include reducing the dimensions (e.g., width) of each stack to increase the space between two adjacent stacks and thus increase the etching window. However, such method would provide a decreased channel width, leading to a degraded device performance.\n\n\"The present disclosure provides semiconductor devices and methods for increasing an etching window associated with the channel release process. An exemplary method for forming a semiconductor device includes forming a number of semiconductor fin-shape stacks protruding from a substrate, where each of the number of fin-shape stacks includes a vertical semiconductor stack of alternating channel layers and sacrificial layers. The exemplary method also includes forming a cladding layer along sidewalls of each stack, conformally depositing a hybrid film over the substrate. The hybrid film includes a first film and a second film on the first film. The first film may be selectively removed during an etching process employed in the channel release process. The exemplary method also includes forming a dielectric filler layer over the hybrid film to fill the space between two adjacent semiconductor fin-shape stacks, selectively recessing the dielectric filler layer and the hybrid film to form a trench, forming a helmet layer in the trench, selectively removing the cladding layer, a portion of the first film extending along sidewalls of the cladding layer, and the sacrificial layers to form openings, and forming a gate structure in the openings. Forming the hybrid film that can be partially removed during the channel release process may facilitate removal of the sacrificial layers and formation of satisfactory gate structures.\"\n\nThe claims supplied by the inventors are:\n\n\"1.

        "Headline":"Chipmakers discuss Trump attack on the CHIPS Act; TSMC response unclear",
        "Story":"Chipmakers discuss Trump attack on the CHIPS Act; TSMC response unclearMar 11, 2025\n\nPresident Trump last month attacked the bipartisan CHIPS Act, seeking to dismantle it, and a new reports says that the White House now appears to have started work on doing so.\n\nA chipmaker\u2019s industry association \u2013 whose members include TSMC \u2013 held a call in which they expressed concerns about the impact on their plans for new US plants \u2026\n\n\u2018Made in America\u2019 Apple chips\n\nApple first announced its plan\u00a0for \u2018Made in America\u2019 chips back in 2022, with the news hailed as one of the success stories of the US CHIPS Act. This is a government subsidy program intended to free the US from dependence on foreign countries for advanced chip supplies and to generate jobs for US workers.\n\nThe initiative will see a series of TSMC chipmaking plants built in Arizona, with some of the production reserved for Apple chips for older devices. Mass production is expected to begin soon at the first of these plants.\n\nTrump\u2019s attacks on the CHIPS Act\n\nWe noted last month that Trump is unhappy with the deal, and has indicated that the White House might renege on it.\n\nTrump wants to tax imported semiconductors and dismantle an incentive scheme under which Washington agreed to subsidise TSMC\u2019s pledged $65bn investment in US production capacity with grants worth $6.6bn.\n\nWhile TSMC appeared to have reached an uneasy truce with the administration, announcing a $100M investment in return for continued support, this has now been thrown into doubt by a new speech by Trump.\n\nChipmakers held a conference call to discuss\n\nThe administration has already made layoffs in the team managing CHIPS Act grants, and The New York Times reports that chipmakers held a conference call to discuss Trump\u2019s latest remarks, in which he went off-script in a speech and called on Congress to reverse the Act.\n\nRepublican lawmakers had sought and received reassurances over the past few months that the Trump administration would support the program Congress created. But halfway through Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks, he called the law a \u201chorrible, horrible thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should get rid of the CHIP Act,\u201d he told Speaker Mike Johnson [\u2026]\n\nThe day after Mr. Trump\u2019s speech, the Semiconductor Industry Association organized a call with member companies, said three people familiar with the discussion. During the call, people chalked up Mr. Trump\u2019s frustration with the law to personal animus with Mr. Biden [\u2026]\n\nChip company executives, worried that funding could be clawed back, are calling lawyers to ask what wiggle room the administration has to terminate signed contracts, said eight people familiar with the requests.\n\nSIA members include AMD, ARM, Intel, Nvidia, Qualcomm, and TSMC.\n\nIf CHIPS Act funding is placed at risk, it\u2019s unclear what impact this would have on TSMC\u2019s plans for future plants \u2013 including the $100M investment recently announced.\n\nStock meeting photo by\u00a0charlesdeluvio\u00a0on\u00a0Unsplash\n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

        "Headline":"Meta (META) Tests AI Chip Production with TSMC to Reduce Reliance on NVIDIA",
        "Story":"Meta (META) Tests AI Chip Production with TSMC to Reduce Reliance on NVIDIAMar 11, 2025\n\nMeta Platforms (META, Financial) is testing AI training chips developed in collaboration with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). This initiative aims to decrease Meta's dependence on NVIDIA (NVDA) and reduce infrastructure costs. If successful, Meta plans to mass-produce these chips to further advance its AI capabilities. Insiders reveal Meta has started small-scale deployments and intends to ramp up production upon successful testing. Both Meta and TSMC have declined to comment on the matter.\n\nThe primary goal behind Meta's chip development is to cut down extensive infrastructure expenses, especially as the company heavily invests in AI tools to drive growth. Meta estimates total expenditures to reach $114 billion to $119 billion by 2025, with up to $65 billion allocated for capital expenditure on AI infrastructure.\n\nThe new training chip, designed as a specialized accelerator, effectively handles AI-specific tasks and is more power-efficient compared to conventional GPUs used for AI operations. Meta's deployment follows the completion of the chip's \"tape-out,\" a significant milestone in semiconductor development indicating that the design has been sent to the fab for manufacturing.\n\nMeta's MTIA series of training and inference accelerators faced challenges in the initial stages, including abandoning a chip at a similar development phase. However, Meta has started utilizing MTIA chips for inference processing, particularly in the recommendation systems on Facebook and Instagram. The leadership aims for full-scale use of these in-house chips by 2026, gradually applying them to generative AI products like Meta's AI chatbot.\n\nDespite some success with their in-house inference chips, Meta had to abandon a project in 2022 due to unsuccessful small-scale testing. They subsequently placed multi-billion-dollar GPU orders with NVIDIA, becoming one of its largest customers and utilizing these GPUs across applications used by over 3 billion users daily.\n\nConcerns have arisen among AI researchers about the growing reliance on data and computational power for large language model development.

        "Headline":"Trump softens tone on Taiwans chip industry after TSMC investment",
        "Story":"Trump softens tone on Taiwans chip industry after TSMC investmentTaipei: Overseas Community Affairs Council, Government of Taiwan has issued the following news release:\n\nWashington, March 7 (CNA) U.S. President Donald Trump softened his stance on Taiwan's semiconductor industry on Friday, just days after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) announced a US$100 billion investment in the United States.\n\nSpeaking at the White House, Trump reiterated that Taiwan \"stole\" the U.S. chip industry but shifted the blame to previous administrations for allowing the computer chip production to move overseas.\n\n\"They stole it from us. They took it from us, and I don't blame them. I give them credit,\" Trump said. \"I blame the people that were sitting in this seat because they allowed it to happen.\"\n\nHe also recalled that Intel was once a dominant player under former CEO Andy Grove, but said it gradually lost its leadership, allowing Taiwan to take over the sector.\n\nFollowing Grove's passing, Trump said, Intel had leaders who \"didn't know what the hell they were doing,\" which led to the U.S. losing its chip industry, now \"almost exclusively in Taiwan.\"\n\nPreviously, Trump had threatened a 100 percent tariff on Taiwan's semiconductor imports to the United States, to encourage domestic chip production. His softened stance comes after TSMC committed on March 4 to building five advanced chip plants in Arizona.\n\nNo U.S. subsidies have been announced as part of this deal.\n\nTrump hailed TSMC's expansion as a major victory for the U.S. because his government did not have to offer any subsidies, and criticized former President Joe Biden's CHIPS and Science Act, which allocated US$52 billion in subsidies to TSMC and other foreign chipmakers to boost local semiconductor manufacturing, calling it a waste of money.\n\nHe argued that TSMC's investment was driven by concerns over tariffs, rather than U.S. government incentives."

        "Headline":"iPad 10 vs. iPad 11 Buyer's Guide: 10+ Differences Compared",
        "Story":"iPad 10 vs. iPad 11 Buyer's Guide: 10+ Differences ComparedMar 10, 2025\n\nApple recently unveiled the 11th-generation iPad, introducing several small upgrades that enhance its popular predecessor. Here's everything that's new.\n\n\nArriving two and a half years after the previous model, the new \u200ciPad\u200c offers a modest spec bump, with no changes to design, cameras, or display technology. The new entry-level \u200ciPad\u200c continues to start at $349, but with double the base storage of its predecessor. All of the differences between the 10th- and 11th-generation \u200ciPad\u200c models are listed below:\n\nWith an A16 chip and 6GB of memory, the new \u200ciPad\u200c is markedly more powerful than its predecessor. With one less CPU core, it may be marginally less capable at multi-core tasks, but overall performance will be considerably better thanks to higher clock speeds, a newer fabrication process, improved efficiency, and additional memory.\n\n\nHowever, neither the 10th- nor 11th-generation iPads support Apple Intelligence. The cheapest \u200ciPad\u200c that does support Apple's suite of AI features is the iPad mini, which starts at $499.\n\n\nIt is likely not worth upgrading from the 10th-generation \u200ciPad\u200c to the new model unless you specifically need more than 256GB of storage or a higher level of performance. Even so, these customers may be better off buying an iPad Air.\n\n\nWhile the previous \u200ciPad\u200c remains capable for simple tasks like media consumption, browsing, and light productivity, its A14 chip is now five years old. Since the entry-level \u200ciPad\u200c is already a relatively inexpensive device compared to other Apple products, it is likely worth opting for the newer model, especially if you plan to keep it for several years.\n\n\nUltimately, the 11th-generation \u200ciPad\u200c is a moderate refresh of Apple's cheapest tablet, aimed primarily at those with a ninth-generation \u200ciPad\u200c, fourth-generation \u200ciPad Air\u200c, or older, as well as anyone who doesn't currently own an \u200ciPad\u200c.\n\n\u200cIPAD\u200c (10TH GENERATION)                                                                     \u200cIPAD\u200c (11TH GENERATION)                                                               \nA14 Bionic chip (introduced with iPhone 12 in 2020, made with TSMC's first 5nm N5 process)   A16 chip (introduced with \u200ciPhone\u200c 14 Pro in 2022, made with TSMC's 4nm N4P process)   \n6-core CPU (2 performance cores and 4 efficiency cores)                                      5-core CPU (2 performance cores and 3 efficiency cores)                                \n11.8 billion transistors                                                                     16 billion transistors                                                                 \n3.0 GHz CPU clock speed                                                                      3.46 GHz CPU clock speed                                                               \n16-core Neural Engine with performance of 11 trillion operations per second                  16-core Neural Engine with performance of 17 trillion operations per second            \n4GB of memory                                                                                6GB of memory                                                                          \n                                                                                             Display Engine                                                                         \nBluetooth 5.2 connectivity                                                                   Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity                                                             \nCellular models support nano-SIM and eSIM                                                    Cellular models support eSIM only                                                      \nSmart HDR 3                                                                                  Smart HDR 4                                                                            \n64GB or 256GB storage                                                                        128GB, 256GB, or 512GB storage                                                         \nIntroduced in October 2022                                                                   Introduced in March 2025                                                               \n\nRelated Roundup: iPad\n\nBuyer's Guide: iPad (Buy Now)\n\nRelated Forum: iPad\n\nThis article, \"iPad 10 vs. iPad 11 Buyer's Guide: 10+ Differences Compared\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums\n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

        "Headline":"TSMC chip plans in US fuel China security fears in Taiwan",
        "Story":"TSMC chip plans in US fuel China security fears in TaiwanMar 10, 2025\n\nChip giant TSMC investing a further $100 billion in US production facilities has set off alarm bells in Taiwan over the integrity of the self-ruled island's \"silicon shield\" against Chinese aggression.After the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world's largest chipmaker, announced a $100 billion (\u20ac92 billion) expansion plan to build factories in the United States, concerns are mounting that offshoring production could weaken the self-ruled island's leverage in securing protection against China.\n\nTSMC is the primary producer of many advanced semiconductors used in everything from smartphones to fighter jets. However, as China has vowed to \"reunite\" Taiwan with the mainland, by using force if necessary, the vulnerability of global semiconductor supply is a key strategic factor.\n\nWith this in mind, US President Donald Trump and former President Joe Biden, have both called for bringing advanced chip production to the US.\n\nDuring campaigning for his second term, Trump, without providing evidence, accused TSMC of \"stealing\" the US chip industry.\n\nIn 2020, TSMC announced billions of dollars in investment to build chip foundries in the southwestern US state of Arizona. After delays and more cash infusions, the first plant there began production in 2024. A second is due to begin production in 2028.\n\n\nIncluding last week's announcement, TSMC's total investment in the US now amounts to $165 billion.\n\nIn a press conference last week, TSMC chairman, CC Wei, and Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te both insisted that the $100 billion investment expansion in the US was not due to pressure from Trump.\n\n\"Whenever TSMC builds a production line outside Taiwan, it is always driven by customer demand,\" Wei said, while assuring that the company's most advanced technology would remain on the island.\n\nHowever, in the press release announcing the investment, Wei said President Trump's \"vision and support\" in 2020 was behind TSMC \"embarking on establishing advanced chip manufacturing in the United States.\"\n\nThe company said its expansion would amount to the \"largest single foreign direct investment in US history\" and include three new fabrication plants, two advanced packaging facilities, and a R&D center.\n\n\"I think TSMC wouldn't have upped their investment without Trump's pressure,\" Antonia Hmaidi, a geopolitical technology analyst at the Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS), told DW.\n\nChiang Min-yen, an economic security researcher at the Digital Society and Technology Research Center (DSET), a Taiwanese think tank, told DW that although TSMC's move was \"not entirely the most economically rational choice,\" it was a \"necessary adjustment in response to global tech geopolitics.\"\n\n\nMaintaining Taiwan's 'silicon shield'\n\nFor many Taiwanese, it is unclear how producing chips in the US at a higher cost will yield a return on investment.\n\nMoreover, while the Taiwanese government lauded the latest deal as a \"historic moment\" for bilateral ties with the US, it has not addressed concerns over Trump's tariff threats or the long-term security provided by the \"silicon shield.\"\n\nThe term refers to Taiwan's indispensable role in the global semiconductor supply chain that could help in deterring a potential invasion by China.\n\nTaiwan dominates global semiconductor manufacturing by producing around 60% of the world's chips, with TSMC being the biggest contributor to maintaining this technological advantage.\n\nWhen the latest deal was announced along with Trump's victorious declaration that \"the most powerful AI chips in the world will be made right here in America,\" alarm bells went off across Taiwan.\n\nThe opposition party Kuomintang (KMT) criticized President Lai for allowing a foreign government to weaken the silicon shield, warning that shifting advanced chip production to the US could lead to a hollowing-out of Taiwan's high-tech industry and endanger national security.\n\n\"I think fundamentally, this move is really designed to make sure that US companies have high-end chips available if there's a blockage around Taiwan,\" Hmaidi from MERICS told DW.\n\nResearcher Chiang said that, even with overseas expansion, Taiwan-based semiconductor production will remain dominant for the foreseeable future.\n\n\"Based on the current construction process in the US, even if technology advances to 2-nanometer chips, completion is expected between 2027 and 2028. Meanwhile, Taiwan has accumulated decades of experience\u2026 with continuous technological advancements,\" he said.\n\n\"The idea of the most advanced technology being transferred is not feasible,\" he added.\n\nTSMC has also invested in factories in Germany and Japan. \n\nTrump's looming tariff threats\n\nBefore TSMC's investment announcement, Trump indicated plans to raise tariffs on chips manufactured in Taiwan to as much as 100%, claiming the tactic would serve as an incentive for companies to bring chip production to the US.\n\nEven after TSMC's investment expansion, Taiwanese semiconductor companies could still face new rounds of tariffs, which Trump is expected to announce on April 2, analysts said.\n\nHowever, the direct impact on TSMC may be limited.\n\n\"The US doesn't directly import many chips from Taiwan \u2014 it mostly imports finished electronic products, like cars and consumer electronics,\" Chiang explained.\n\n\nChiang warned that Taiwan must remain \"critical\" of Trump's next moves and actively engage in negotiations based on mutual security and interests.\n\n\"Whether it's Biden's CHIPS and Science Act or Trump's policies, both aim to expand US domestic manufacturing,\" he said, referring to a law signed by the former president that provides government subsidies for chipmaking on US soil.\n\nTrump has blasted Biden's policy as \"giving away\" money, insisting that chipmakers need \"incentives\" such as tariffs to build on US soil.\n\n\"Taiwan should ask itself: What kind of chip supply chain strategy best serves its own interest?\" Chiang added.\n\nSo far, Trump has not overtly indicated an official stance on US security support to Taiwan, other than repeating Taiwan should pay more to the US for providing defense against China. \n\n\nDW's reporter Yu-Chun Chou contributed to this report\n\nEdited by: Wesley Rahn\n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

The companys SEMVision H20 system combines the industrys most sensitive electron beam (eBeam) technology with advanced AI image recognition to enable better and faster analysis of buried nanoscale defects in the worlds most advanced chips.\n\neBeam imaging has long been an important tool for examining defects that are too small to be seen with optical techniques. Its ultra-high resolution enables analysis of the tiniest imperfections in a sea of billions of nanoscale circuit patterns. Traditionally, optical techniques are used to scan a wafer for potential defects, and then eBeam is deployed to better characterize these defects. In the emerging angstrom era where the smallest chip features can be just a few atoms thick it is becoming increasingly difficult to differentiate true defects from false alarms.\n\nAt todays most advanced nodes, optical inspection creates much denser defect maps, which can require as much as a 100X increase in the number of defect candidates delivered to eBeam review. Process control engineers increasingly need defect review systems that can analyze exponentially more samples while maintaining the speed and sensitivity required for high-volume production.\n\nOur new SEMVision H20 system allows the worlds leading chipmakers to better separate the signal from the noise amidst massive amounts of data provided by inspection tools, said Keith Wells, Group Vice President of Imaging and Process Control at Applied Materials. By combining advanced AI algorithms with the superior speed and resolution of our innovative eBeam technology, our system enables rapid identification of the smallest defects buried deep in 3D device structures, delivering faster and more accurate inspection results that can improve factory cycle time and yield.\n\nApplieds new eBeam technology is critical for complex 3D architecture inflections required to manufacture logic chips at the 2nm node and beyond including new Gate-All-Around (GAA) transistors as well as the formation of higher-density DRAM and 3D NAND memories.\n\nTAIWAN SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING PRESS RELEASES AND CORPORATE WIRE\n\nMarch 04: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing announces dividend\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing today announced a cash dividend of TWD4.50 per share.

        "Story":"TSMC Reports 43% Revenue Surge in February, Plans $100 Billion U.S. InvestmentMar 10, 2025\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM, Financials) reported a 43% year-over-year increase in revenue for February 2025, reaching NT$260.01 billion ($8.2 billion), driven by strong demand for artificial intelligence chips.\n\nRising 39% year over year to NT$553.30 billion ($17.4 billion), revenue for the first two months of the year above the 34% increase seen in early 2024. Seasonal changes in semiconductor orders caused February income to drop 11.3% from January, despite yearly growth.\n\nEspecially for AI-related circuits, TSMC, a leading supplier of Apple (AAPL, Financials), Nvidia (NVDA, Financials), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD, Financials), continues to be a significant gauge of world semiconductor demand. Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei said the corporation could handle the minor problem of U.S. export restrictions on AI chip deliveries.\n\nWith many production sites and research centers under construction, the corporation intends to spend $100 billion in U.S. semiconductor manufacture over the next five years. Nonetheless, the fate of U.S. government subsidies is still unknown as President Donald Trump has suggested discontinuing the $52 billion semiconductor subsidy program, which has helped chipmakers to fund more than $400 billion in private-sector investments.\n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Hsing\n\nCEO & President & Chairman\n\nIt started with a vision. Michael Hsing, pioneering engineer, Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer, founded Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. (MPS) in 1997 with the belief that an entire power system could be integrated onto a single chip, which would greatly enhance system performance and eliminate most of the iterative design efforts. Prior to founding MPS, Michael was a Senior Silicon Technology Developer at several analog IC companies, where he developed and patented key technologies, which set new standards in the Power Electronics industry.\n\nIn order to execute his vision, he created groundbreaking enabling technologies using a fully integrated power process in a CMOS foundry. In May of 1998, a single-chip solution for powering CCFL backlighting in Notebooks was launched. The product substantially reduced the total solution cost and design complexity, as well as significantly improved power conversion. As a result, this product stormed the laptop market by taking 40% market share in 2003 and 80% in 2005.\n\nImmediately the company diversified into DC\/DC products, which again reset the industry standard. In November 2004, Michael took the company IPO. Since then, the company has grown to 6 product lines with more than 1000 products and thousands of customers. In 2013, Michael fulfilled his vision: MPS introduced an industry first - a cost effective Monolithic Power Module that truly integrates an entire power system onto a single package, entering the industry into a new era of power management.\n\nToday with 18 years of nonstop innovation, MPS is pushing technology to an unprecedented level: 1200 volts and 80A current with the 5th generation of process technology, continuing to lead the power semiconductor industry.\n\nWhether he is flying planes, white water kayaking, or mountain biking, Michael is constantly creating cutting-edge solutions to improve the quality of life with green, easy-to-use power solutions. Under his passionate and creative leadership, MPS has succeeded not only in developing a monolithic power module that truly integrates an entire power system in a single package, but also it continues to defy industry expectations with its patented groundbreaking technologies.\n\nShareholder Value:\n\nCreation of shareholder value in Monolithic Power Systems:\n\nYear of appointment: 2010\n\nIn the last 10 years the average annualized return to shareholders was 28.8%.

        "Headline":"TSMC's $100 Billion Power Move: A Game-Changer or a Geopolitical Gamble?",
        "Story":"TSMC's $100 Billion Power Move: A Game-Changer or a Geopolitical Gamble?Mar 10, 2025\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM, Financial) is making big moves, and investors are paying attention. The semiconductor giant just posted February revenue of NT$260 billion\u2014down 11% from January but up a staggering 43% year-over-year. That puts the company at 66.4% of its projected Q1 revenue midpoint, tracking ahead of historical trends. Bernstein SocGen isn't blinking, reaffirming its Outperform rating with a $251 price target, betting on TSMC's ability to outpace expectations despite disruptions from January's earthquake. With a gross margin of 56.12% and a P\/E ratio of 22.21, TSMC isn't just surviving\u2014it's thriving. Analysts expect March revenue to come in lower than usual due to production hiccups, but the bigger picture remains intact: TSMC is still the undisputed leader in semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nBut it's not just the numbers that have the market buzzing. TSMC's massive $100 billion investment in the U.S. is reshaping the global chip game. The company insists this expansion\u2014covering three new fabrication plants and a cutting-edge R&D center\u2014is purely business, driven by customer demand. But the geopolitical undercurrents are impossible to ignore. With China's ambitions toward Taiwan and Trump floating 100% chip tariffs, the stakes are rising. Critics in Taiwan warn that shifting production overseas could weaken the island's \"silicon shield\"\u2014the very thing that keeps Taiwan strategically essential to global tech. The investment signals a major shift in semiconductor supply chains, with the U.S. doubling down on domestic chipmaking to secure its own AI future.\n\nMeanwhile, Intel (INTC) is fighting to stay relevant. Northland just reiterated its Outperform rating with a $28 price target, but the company is still playing catch-up to TSMC in manufacturing tech. JPMorgan and Citi are keeping faith in TSMC, highlighting its dominance in AI chip production and its strategic advantage in the semiconductor race. With demand for high-performance chips surging, the next few quarters will be critical in determining how TSMC's expansion plays out\u2014whether it cements its dominance or opens the door for unexpected challengers. Either way, investors are in for a wild ride.\n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

        "Story":"TSMC revenue hits record February high of NT$260 billionTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) set a new all-time revenue record for February.\n\nTSMC reported NT$260.09 billion (US$7.91 billion) in revenue last month, marking a 43.1% year-over-year increase despite an 11.3% decline from January, CNA reported. While it was a five-month low, it still set a record high for February.\n\nFor the first two months of the year, TSMC's total revenue reached NT$553.3 billion, a 39.2% increase compared to the same period last year.\n\nAnalysts attributed February's month-over-month decline to fewer working days but noted that strong demand for AI chips drove the year-over-year growth.\n\nTSMC previously estimated that the magnitude 6.4 earthquake on Jan. 21 and subsequent aftershocks affected a certain number of wafers in production. As a result, the company expects first-quarter revenue to be closer to the lower end of its previous guidance range of US$25 billion to US$25.8 billion.\n\nGiven TSMC's assumed NT$32.8 per US$1 exchange rate for the first quarter, the market projects that March revenue could rebound to over NT$266.7 billion.\n\nTSMC estimates that after insurance claims, earthquake-related losses for the first quarter will total approximately NT$5.3 billion. The company expects a gross margin of 57% to 59% and forecasts full-year US dollar revenue growth of 24% to 26%."

(Nasdaq: GSIT), the inventor of the Associative Processing Unit (APU), a paradigm shift in AI and HPC processing providing true compute-in-memory technology, today reiterated the key highlights from its recent earnings call for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 held on Thursday, May 2, 2024.\n\nKey Business Updates from Earnings Call\n\nKey Highlights from Gemini-II Update on Earnings Call\n\nEngaging Needham & Company underscores our proactive approach to fortifying our market position and financial health and maximizing stockholder value, said Lee-Lean Shu, CEO of GSI Technology. We are making excellent progress with our second generation of the APU, Gemini-II, and are extremely encouraged by the chip's results in testing, which has verified that instructions can be successfully executed through the embedded processor and that the data path is also working. Once we receive the second spin of Gemini-II this fall, we intend to initiate benchmarking that will allow us to begin preliminary customer sampling and engage with target customers before the calendar year-end.\n\nThe second generation of our APU brings significant performance enhancements, with more processing power and memory density, and suitable for both low power data center expansion and enabling data center functions at the edge, continued Mr. Shu. These capabilities empower local execution of computationally intensive tasks, increasing edge application capabilities. Additionally, Gemini-IIs memory can hold an entire small database, a potential door-opener for enhanced performance in image recognition applications. These small model sizes use algorithms with low precision model weight size to lower memory storage requirements and simplify computations, which the APU architecture is better suited for than traditional GPU architectures.\n\nPress Release article 14 of 18, Source: West Corporation, 71 words\n\nMay 02 2024: GSI Technology, Inc.

(Nasdaq: GSIT), the inventor of the Associative Processing Unit (APU), a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance compute (HPC) processing providing true compute-in-memory technology, today announced the release in production of two high capacity, low power server products.The Leda-E and Leda-S boards incorporate the Gemini-I APU, capable of 1.2 POPs at 80W and 800 TOPs at 40W, respectively. The new server offerings are available as a single 2U server of eight Leda-E boards at 10 POPs, and a 1U server of sixteen Leda-S boards, totaling 13 POPs.\n\nGSI's true compute-in-memory technology has proven differentiated capabilities in large (billion item) database search and high-performancecomputeapplications, such as facial recognition, drug discovery, Opensearch, and object detection and re-identification. The low 1.2kW full server power of these formidable systems unlocks the potential for the 1U server to be used in mobile or remote applications.\n\nSingle card versions of the Gemini-I have shown six-fold performance improvement over the Xeon CPU for seed location filtering in DNA read mapping by Cornell University1. Similarly, the Gemini-I has shown equivalent performance to the A100 for cryptography applications, such as high throughput hash-based security protocols, as demonstrated by Northern Arizona University (NAU)2. NAU found that an 8-card APU server would be compelling for further evaluation due to its smaller form factor in a 2U server compared to an equivalent A100 GPU system.\n\nServer systems based on GSIs production Gemini-I APU chip come pre-bundled with an application development compiler and can be further customized with Real-Time Fast Back Projection software or Fast Vector Search support.\n\nSystems are shipping from stock.\n\nPress Release article 17 of 18, 281 words\n\nMarch 31 2024: GSI Technology: File SEC Form 10-K - Management's Discussion and Analysis 10-K\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Our initial associative processing unit (\"APU\") products are focused on applications using similarity search, but have not resulted in material revenues to date. Similarity search is used in visual search queries for ecommerce, computer vision, drug discovery, cybersecurity and service markets such as NoSQL, Elasticsearch, and OpenSearch. We have solutions to accelerate multimodal vector search as an on-prem or SaaS solution for OpenSearch and general Fast Vector Search, and for processing large area SAR images in real-time at high resolution. We also design, develop and market static random access memories, or SRAMs (our current primary revenue source), that operate at speeds of less than 10 nanoseconds, which we refer to as Very Fast SRAMs, primarily for the networking and telecommunications and the military\/defense and aerospace markets. We are subject to the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, which has experienced significant fluctuations, often in connection with fluctuations in demand for the products in which semiconductor devices are used. Our revenues have been substantially impacted by significant fluctuations in sales to our largest customer, Nokia. We expect that future direct and indirect sales to Nokia will continue to fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. The networking and telecommunications market has accounted for a significant portion of our net revenues in the past and has declined during the past several years and is expected to continue to decline. In anticipation of the decline of the networking and telecommunications market, we have been using the revenue generated by the sales of high-speed synchronous SRAM products to finance the development of our new in-place associative computing solutions and the marketing and sale of new types of SRAM products such as radiation-hardened and radiation-tolerant SRAMs.\n\nOur revenues in recent years were impacted by changes in customer buying patterns and communication limitations related to COVID-19 restrictions that required a significant number of our customer contacts to work from home. While the COVID-19 pandemic has ended, worldwide inflationary pressures, higher interest rates and decline in the global economic environment have had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and financial condition. Furthermore, the easing of supply chain shortages and prior buffer stock purchases from significant customers led to a decrease in revenues in the second half of fiscal 2023 and during fiscal 2024.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $14.4 million, with no debt. We have a team in-place with tremendous depth and breadth of experience and knowledge, with a legacy business that is providing an ongoing source of funding for the development of new product lines. Our balance sheet and liquidity position has been strengthened by the recent sale of our Sunnyvale, California property, which we anticipate will provide further financial flexibility and security in the current environment of economic uncertainty. Generally, our primary source of liquidity is cash equivalents. Our level of cash equivalents has historically been sufficient to meet our current and\n\nlonger term operating and capital needs. We believe that during the next 12 months, continued inflationary pressures and higher interest rates will continue to negatively impact general economic activity and demand in our end markets. Although it is difficult to estimate the length or gravity of the continued inflationary pressures and higher interest rates, the evolving conflict in the Middle East and the decline in the global economic environment, are expected to have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, including potential impairments, and liquidity into fiscal 2025.\n\nRevenues. Substantially all of our revenues are derived from sales of our Very Fast SRAM products. Sales to networking and telecommunications OEMs accounted for 32% to 49% of our net revenues during our last three fiscal years. We also sell our products to OEMs that manufacture products for military and aerospace applications such as radar and guidance systems and satellites, for test and measurement applications such as high-speed testers, for automotive applications such as smart cruise control, and for medical applications such as ultrasound and CAT scan equipment.\n\nAs is typical in the semiconductor industry, the selling prices of our products generally decline over the life of the product. Our ability to increase net revenues, therefore, is dependent upon our ability to increase unit sales volumes of existing products and to introduce and sell new products with higher average selling prices in quantities sufficient to compensate for the anticipated declines in selling prices of our more mature products. Although we expect the average selling prices of individual products to decline over time, we believe that, over the next several quarters, our overall average selling prices will increase due to a continuing shift in product mix to a higher percentage of higher price, higher density products, and to a lesser extent, recent price increases to our customers due to supply constraints. Our ability to increase unit sales volumes is dependent primarily upon increases in customer demand but, particularly in periods of increasing demand, can also be affected by our ability to increase production through the availability of increased wafer fabrication capacity from TSMC, our wafer supplier, and our ability to increase the number of good integrated circuit die produced from each wafer through die size reductions and yield enhancement activities.\n\nWe may experience fluctuations in quarterly net revenues for a number of reasons. Historically, orders on hand at the beginning of each quarter are insufficient to meet our revenue objectives for that quarter and are generally cancelable up to 30 days prior to scheduled delivery. Accordingly, we depend on obtaining and shipping orders in the same quarter to achieve our revenue objectives. In addition, the timing of product releases, purchase orders and product availability could result in significant product shipments at the end of a quarter. Failure to ship these products by the end of the quarter may adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, our customers may delay scheduled delivery dates and\/or cancel orders within specified timeframes without significant penalty.\n\nWe sell our products through our direct sales force, international and domestic sales representatives and distributors. Our revenues have been and are expected to continue to be impacted by changes in customer buying patterns and communication limitations related to changes in working habits that have resulted in a significant number of our customer contacts working from home. Our customer contracts, which may be in the form of purchase orders, contracts or purchase agreements, contain performance obligations for delivery of agreed upon products. Delivery of all performance obligations contained within a contract with a customer typically occurs at the same time (or within the same accounting period). Transfer of control occurs at the time of shipment, title and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, and we have a right to payment. Thus, we will recognize revenue upon shipment of the product for direct sales and sales to our distributors.\n\nHistorically, a small number of OEM customers have accounted for a substantial portion of our net revenues, and we expect that significant customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future. Many of our OEMs use contract manufacturers to manufacture their equipment. Accordingly, a significant percentage of our net revenues is derived from sales to these contract manufacturers. In addition, a significant portion of our sales are\n\nmade to foreign and domestic distributors who resell our products to OEMs, as well as their contract manufacturers. Direct sales to contract manufacturers accounted for 20.5%, 19.8% and 31.0% of our net revenues for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Sales to foreign and domestic distributors accounted for 76.4%, 77.5% and 66.8% of our net revenues for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The following direct customers accounted for 10% or more of our net revenues in one or more of the following periods:\n\nNokia was our largest customer in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022. Nokia purchases products directly from us and through contract manufacturers and distributors. Based on information provided to us by its contract manufacturers and our distributors, purchases by Nokia represented approximately 21%, 17% and 29% of our net revenues in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our revenues have been substantially impacted by significant fluctuations in sales to Nokia, and we expect that future direct and indirect sales to Nokia will continue to fluctuate substantially on a quarterly basis and that such fluctuations may significantly affect our operating results in future periods. To our knowledge, none of our other OEM customers accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues in fiscal 2024, 2023 or 2022.\n\nCost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues consists primarily of wafer fabrication costs, wafer sort, assembly, test and burn-in expenses, the amortized cost of production mask sets, stock-based compensation and the cost of materials and overhead from operations. All of our wafer manufacturing and assembly operations, and a significant portion of our wafer sort testing operations, are outsourced. Accordingly, most of our cost of revenues consists of payments to TSMC and independent assembly and test houses. Because we do not have long-term, fixed-price supply contracts, our wafer fabrication, assembly and other outsourced manufacturing costs are subject to the cyclical fluctuations in demand for semiconductors. We have experienced increased costs as a result of supply chain constraints for wafers and outsourced assembly, burn-in and test operations. We review our manufacturing costs on a regular basis and pass on any cost increases to our customers when it makes sense to do so. Cost of revenues also includes expenses related to supply chain management, quality assurance, and final product testing and documentation control activities conducted at our headquarters in Sunnyvale, California and our branch operations in Taiwan.\n\nGross Profit. Our gross profit margins vary among our products and are generally greater on our radiation hardened and radiation tolerant SRAMs, on our higher density products and, within a particular density, greater on our higher speed and industrial temperature products. We expect that our overall gross margins will fluctuate from period to period as a result of shifts in product mix, changes in average selling prices and our ability to control our cost of revenues, including costs associated with outsourced wafer fabrication and product assembly and testing.\n\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for design engineers and other technical personnel, the cost of developing prototypes, stock-based compensation and fees paid to consultants. We charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred. We charge mask costs used in production to cost of revenues over a 12-month period. However, we charge costs related to pre-production mask sets, which are not used in production, to research and development expenses at the time they are incurred. These charges often arise as we transition to new process technologies and, accordingly,\n\ncan cause research and development expenses to fluctuate on a quarterly basis. We incurred charges of $2.4 million for a pre-production mask set for our APU2 during the quarter ended December 31, 2023. We believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to our long-term success, and we expect to continue to devote significant resources to product development activities. In particular, we are devoting substantial resources to the development of our in-place associative computing products. Accordingly, we expect that our research and development expenses will continue to be substantial in future periods and may lead to operating losses in some periods. Such expenses as a percentage of net revenues may fluctuate from period to period.\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of commissions paid to independent sales representatives, salaries, stock-based compensation and related expenses for personnel engaged in sales, marketing, administrative, finance and human resources activities, professional fees, costs associated with the promotion of our products and other corporate expenses. We expect that our sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods if we are able to grow and expand our sales force but that, to the extent our revenues increase in future periods, these expenses will generally decline as a percentage of net revenues. We also expect that, in support of any future growth that we are able to achieve, general and administrative expenses will generally increase in absolute dollars.\n\nAcquisition:\n\nOn November 23, 2015, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of privately held MikaMonu Group Ltd. (\"MikaMonu\"), a development-stage, Israel-based company that specialized in in-place associative computing for markets including big data, computer vision and cyber security. MikaMonu, located in Tel Aviv, held 12 United States patents and had a number of pending patent applications.\n\nThe acquisition was undertaken in order to gain access to the MikaMonu patents and the potential markets, and new customer base in those markets, that can be served by new products that we are developing using the in-place associative computing technology.\n\nThe acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase under authoritative guidance for business combinations. The purchase price of the acquisition was allocated to the intangible assets acquired, with the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired recorded as goodwill. We perform a goodwill impairment test near the end of each fiscal year and if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on an interim basis.\n\nThe acquisition agreement provides for potential \"earnout\" payments to the former MikaMonu shareholders in cash or shares of our common stock, at our discretion, during a period of up to ten years following the closing if certain revenue targets for products based on the MikaMonu technology are achieved. Earnout payments, up to a maximum of $30.0 million, equal to 5% of net revenues from the sale of qualifying products in excess of certain thresholds, will be made quarterly through December 31, 2025. As of March 31, 2024, none of the revenue targets have been achieved and no revenue based earnout payments have been paid to the former MikaMonu shareholders.\n\nThe maximum amount of the remaining potential earnout payments totals approximately $30.0 million at March 31, 2024. We determined that the fair value of this contingent consideration liability was $5.8 million at the acquisition date. The contingent consideration liability is included in contingent consideration, non-current on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at March 31, 2023 and 2024 in the amount of $1.1 million and $160,000, respectively\n\nAt each reporting period, the contingent consideration liability is re-measured at then current fair value with changes recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Changes in any of the inputs may result in significant adjustments to the recorded fair value. Re-measurement of the contingent consideration liability during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 resulted in a decrease of the contingent consideration liability of $0.9 million.\n\nThe allocation of the purchase price to acquired identifiable intangible assets and goodwill was based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The fair value allocated to patents was $3.5 million and the residual value allocated to goodwill was $8.0 million.\n\nResults of Operations Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2024 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2023\n\nNet Revenues. Net revenues decreased by 26.7% from $29.7 million in fiscal 2023 to $21.8 million in fiscal 2024. The overall average selling price of all units shipped in fiscal 2024 increased by 20.8% in fiscal 2024 compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease in net revenues is related to the current economic environment which has led to cautionary spending by our customers and purchases made as a result of supply chain constraints in the previous periods. Units shipped decreased by 39.3% in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. The networking and telecommunications markets represented 34% and 32% of shipments in fiscal 2024 and in fiscal 2023, respectively. Direct and indirect sales to Nokia, currently our largest customer, decreased by $500,000 from $5.0 million in fiscal 2023 to $4.5 million fiscal 2024. Shipments to Nokia will continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of demand and shipments to its end customers. While recent customer order patterns have been particularly variable, these fluctuations are related to economic and external factors, which include worldwide inflationary pressures, higher interest rates and the decline in the global economic environment. Shipments of our SigmaQuad product line accounted for 51.2% of total shipments in fiscal 2024 compared to 49.1% of total shipments in fiscal 2023\n\nCost of Revenues. Cost of revenues decreased by 17.2% from $12.0 million in fiscal 2023 to $9.9 million in fiscal 2024. Cost of revenues decreased as a result of the lower volume of units shipped in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 as discussed above. Cost of revenues included a provision for excess and obsolete inventories of $180,000 in fiscal 2024 compared to $226,000 in fiscal 2023. Cost of revenues included stock-based compensation expense of $228,000 and $202,000, respectively, in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023.\n\nGross Profit. Gross profit decreased by 33.1% from $17.7 million in fiscal 2023 to $11.8 million in fiscal 2024. Gross margin decreased from 59.6% in fiscal 2023 to 54.3% in fiscal 2024. The change in gross profit is primarily related to the change in net revenues discussed above. The decrease in gross margin was primarily related to change in the mix of products and customers and also reflects the impact of fixed overhead on lower shipment levels compared to the prior year. Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses decreased 7.9% from $23.6 million in fiscal 2023 to $21.7 million in fiscal 2024. The reduction in research and development spending in fiscal 2024 reflects the impact of cost reduction measures implemented in the quarter ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in research and development spending was primarily related to decreases of $2.2 million in payroll related expenses and $1.4 million in outside consulting expenses for the development of our APU-2 product. The decrease in research and development spending was partially offset by an increase in pre-production mask costs of $2.4 million related to our APU-2 product. Research and development expenses in fiscal 2024 were also offset by $435,000 of funding received under the Direct to Phase II award for the development of a Next-Generation Associative Processing Unit-2 for Enhanced Space-Based Capabilities. Research and development expenses included stock-based compensation expense of $1.4 million and $1.3 million in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively.\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 6.3% from $9.9 million in fiscal 2023 to $10.6 million in fiscal 2024. In fiscal 2024, the value of contingent consideration liability resulting from the MikaMonu acquisition decreased by $892,000 compared to a decrease of $1.7 million in fiscal 2023 as a result of re-measurement of contingent consideration liability in each year. Decreases of $554,000 in payroll related expenses and $196,000 in outside sales representative commissions were partially offset by increases of $284,000 in outside consultants and $234,000 in professional fees. Selling, general and administrative expenses included stock-based compensation expense of $1.2 million and $951,000 in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively.\n\nInterest Income and Other (Expense), Net. Interest income and other (expense), net increased from income of $202,000 in fiscal 2023 to income of $414,000 in fiscal 2024. Interest income increased by $232,000 due to higher interest rates received on cash and short-term investments. The foreign currency exchange loss increased from ($121,000) in fiscal 2023 to ($127,000) in fiscal 2024. The exchange loss in each period was primarily related to our Taiwan branch operations and operations in Israel.\n\nProvision (benefit) for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes decreased from $372,000 in fiscal 2023 to $70,000 in fiscal 2024. The provision for income taxes in fiscal 2024 included a benefit of ($117,000) related to the approval by the Israel tax authorities of a \"Preferred Company\" tax rate that was retroactively applied to fiscal 2023. Because we recorded a cumulative three-year loss on a U.S. tax basis for the year ended March 31, 2024 and the realization of our deferred tax assets is questionable, we recorded a tax provision reflecting a valuation allowance of $20.2 million in net deferred tax assets in fiscal 2024. Reductions in uncertain tax benefits due to lapses in the statute of limitations were not significant in the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nNet Loss. Net loss was ($16.0) million in fiscal 2023 compared to a net loss of ($20.1) million in fiscal 2024. This decrease was primarily due to the changes in net revenues, gross profit and operating expenses discussed above.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources:\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of $14.4 million compared to $30.6 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of March 31, 2023. Cash and cash equivalents totaling $9.4 million were held in foreign locations as of March 31, 2024.\n\nNet cash used in operating activities was $17.4 million and $16.8 million for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively. The primary uses of cash in fiscal 2024 were the net loss of $20.1 million and a decrease of $1.6 million in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The reduction in accrued expenses and other liabilities was primarily related to decreases in compensation related accruals, income taxes payable and deferred revenue. The uses of cash in fiscal 2024 were less than the net loss due to non-cash items including stock-based compensation of\n\n$2.8 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $927,000. The primary source of cash in fiscal 2024 was a decrease in inventories of $1.3 million.\n\nThe primary uses of cash in fiscal 2023 were the net loss of $16.0 million, a reduction in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $2.3 million and an increase in inventories of $2.0 million. The reduction in accrued expenses and other liabilities was primarily related to the payment of fiscal 2022 year-end accruals for incentive compensation. The uses of cash in fiscal 2023 were less than the net loss due to non-cash items including stock-based compensation of $2.5 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $1.0 million. The primary source of cash in fiscal 2023 was a decrease in accounts receivable of $1.1 million.\n\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $2.8 million and $6.7 million in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. Investment activities in fiscal 2024 primarily consisted of the maturity of certificates of deposit and agency bonds of $3.4 million partially offset by the purchase of property and equipment of $645,000. Investment activities in fiscal 2023 primarily consisted of the maturity of certificates of deposit and agency bonds of $7.0 million partially offset by the purchase of property and equipment of $316,000.\n\nCash provided by financing activities was $1.8 million and $402,000 in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively and consisted of the net proceeds from the sale of common stock pursuant to our employee stock plans.\n\nAt March 31, 2024, we had total minimum lease obligations of approximately $1.6 million from April 1, 2023 through April 30, 2027, under non-cancelable operating leases for our facilities.\n\nWhile higher interest rates, worldwide inflationary pressures and the decline in the global economic environment have created significant uncertainty as to general economic and capital market conditions for the remainder of calendar 2024 and beyond, we believe that our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents, and cash flow expected to be generated from our future operations and the net proceeds of approximately $11.2 million from the sale of our headquarters building in Sunnyvale, CA which closed on June 6, 2024 will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including revenue growth, if any, that we experience, any additional manufacturing cost increases resulting from supply constraints and the continuation of the impact of higher interest rates and inflation may have on our business, the extent to which we utilize subcontractors, the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain, the timing and extent of spending to support our product development efforts and the expansion of our sales and marketing team. Additional capital may also be required for the consummation of any acquisition of businesses, products or technologies that we may undertake. On June 28, 2023, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3, which was declared effective by the SEC on July 19, 2023. On August 1, 2023, we commenced a registered securities offering pursuant to a Sales Agreement (the \"Sales Agreement\") with Needham & Company, LLC (\"Needham\"). The Sales Agreement provides that we may offer and sell our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $25.0 million from time to time (the \"Offering\") through Needham, acting as our sales agent. We sold 133,000 shares pursuant to the offering at an average price of $4.20 for proceeds of $542,000, less offering costs of $389,000 during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. We cannot assure that additional equity or debt financing, if required, will be available on terms that are acceptable or at all.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had $2.2 million in purchase obligations for facility leases, wafers and software and test purchase obligations that are binding commitments, of which $1.2 million are payable in the next twelve months and $1.0 million are committed in the long term.\n\nIn connection with the acquisition of MikaMonu on November 23, 2015, we are required to make contingent consideration payments to the former MikaMonu shareholders conditioned upon the achievement of certain revenue\n\ntargets for products based on the MikaMonu technology. As of March 31, 2024, the accrual for potential payment of contingent consideration was $160,000.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates:\n\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\") requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates are inherent in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and include estimates affecting obsolete and excess inventory and contingent consideration. We believe that we consistently apply these judgments and estimates and that our financial statements and accompanying notes fairly represent our financial results for all periods presented. However, any errors in these judgments and estimates may have a material impact on our balance sheet and statement of operations. Critical accounting estimates, as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult and subjective judgments and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our critical accounting estimates include those regarding the valuation of inventories and contingent consideration.\n\nValuation of Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, cost being determined on a weighted average basis. Our inventory write-down allowance is established when conditions indicate that the selling price of our products could be less than cost due to physical deterioration, obsolescence based on changes in technology and demand, changes in price levels, or other causes. We consider the need to establish the allowance for excess inventory generally based on inventory levels in excess of 12 months of forecasted customer demand for each specific product, which is based on historical sales and expected future orders. At any point in time, some portion of our inventory is subject to the risk of being materially in excess of our projected demand. Additionally, our average selling prices could decline due to market or other conditions, which creates a risk that costs of manufacturing our inventory may not be recovered. These factors contribute to the risk that we may be required to record additional inventory write-downs in the future, which could be material. In addition, if actual market conditions are more favorable than expected, inventory previously written down may be sold to customers resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period.\n\nContingent Consideration. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability potentially payable in connection with our acquisition of MikaMonu was initially determined as of the acquisition date using unobservable inputs. These inputs included the estimated amount and timing of future revenue, the probability of achievement of the revenue forecast, and a risk-adjusted discount rate to adjust the probability-weighted cash flow payments to their present value. Since the acquisition date, at each reporting period, the contingent consideration liability is re-measured at its then current fair value with changes recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Due to revisions to the amount of expected revenue, the timing of revenue to be recognized prior to the end of the earnout period and the probability of achievement of the APU revenue forecast, the contingent consideration liability decreased by $892,000 from March 31, 2023 to March 31, 2024. Future changes to any of the inputs, including forecasted revenues from a new product, which are inherently difficult to estimate, or the valuation model selected, may result in material adjustments to the recorded fair value.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements:\n\nPlease refer to Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements appearing under Part II, Item 8 for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that may impact the Company.\n\nSECTION 4 INSTITUTIONAL OWNERSHIP UPDATED AFTER LAST SEC FILING Q4\/2024 REPORTED ON FEB 17\n\nInstitutional Ownership as at Dec 31, 2024\n\n4.1 Reported holdings of institutions end of quarter\n\nAs at December 31, 2024 institutions had decreased their holdings to 10.5% of issued capital, down from 11.7% nine months ago.\n\nQuarter - ended       Dec 31, 2024   Sep 30, 2024   Jun 30, 2024   Mar 31, 2024   \n% of issued capital   10.5           10.2           10.5           11.7           \n\n4.2 Top 5 Institutional Ownership of GSI Technology as at December 31, 2024\n\nAs at December 31, 2024, 34 Institutions (Funds) held investments in shares of GSI Technology.

        "Story":"Taiwan Semiconductor's February revenue surges 43% year-on-year, falls on a monthly basisTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's (NYSE:TSM) revenue for February 2024 jumped 43% year-over-year to NT$260.01B, amid growing demand for AI applications.\n\nTSM \u2014 which produces chips for some of the world's largest tech companies including Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), and AMD (AMD) \u2014 saw revenue for the January-February grow about 39% year-over-year to around NT$553.30B. That compares with 34% growth during the full year of 2024.\n\nHowever, on a consolidated basis, TSMC saw a decrease of 11.3% in revenue compared to a month ago.\n\nTSMC's sales are a barometer for the semiconductor sector as the company manufactures most of the AI chips in the world, and the numbers come amid heated competition in the AI landscape, despite uncertainties.\n\nTSM Chief Executive C.C Wei said on the company's earnings call that U.S. export controls on AI chips were a manageable issue for the company.\n\nThe company is also set to invest $100B over the next few years in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing, including the establishment of new chip fabs and research facilities.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has meanwhile called for ending a bipartisan $52 billion semiconductor subsidy program that's spurred more than $400 billion in investments from companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Intel Corp.\n\nElsewhere, TSMC rival Intel's (INTC) $28 billion chip fabrication plants in Ohio are facing further delays, with the first factory in New Albany expected to be completed only by 2030.\n\n\u00a9 2022 Seeking Alpha Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

Therefore, investing in the United States provides business continuity for its most important companies in the event of a disaster . \n With President Trump welcoming TSMC\u2019s plans to acquire financially troubled Intel, the investments are expected to pave the way for these plans to materialize, and the overall outcome could change the global geo-technological landscape in the advanced chip industry."

After successfully trading Nvidia options, Duan revealed on social media his plan to enter the TSM market by selling put options. He intends to sell 100 contracts of TSM's January 16, 2026, $175 strike price put options at a limit price of $23.2, a strategy indicating a bullish outlook on AI hardware.\n\nDuan's confidence in TSM (ticker: TSM) is based on several factors. He praises the company's robust business model and corporate culture, highlighting its focus on semiconductor foundries. He recalls a prediction he made 30 years ago, stating that TSMC would surpass competitors like UMC and Samsung due to its dedicated approach. Additionally, Duan appreciates TSMC as a strong business-to-business company, recognizing its market position alongside other giants like Microsoft.\n\nInterestingly, Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) also invested in TSMC through Berkshire Hathaway, acquiring $4.1 billion worth of shares in the third quarter of 2022. The investment made TSMC Berkshire's tenth largest holding. However, Buffett quickly reduced the stake by 86% and exited completely by the first quarter of 2023. During the 2023 Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting, Buffett praised TSMC as one of the world's best-managed companies but expressed concerns over its geographical location.\n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Recently, Duang shared on social media that the expiration of many put options in January freed up significant cash. He noted the high valuations in the U.S. stock market and the decreasing interest on T-bills, making investment decisions challenging. Duang reflected on TSMC, acknowledging its impressive performance since he first became aware of it 35 years ago. Despite TSMC being a capital-intensive business, he found the idea of being fully invested appealing, although staying in cash was somewhat uncomfortable.\n\nAfter selling put options on NVIDIA, Duang has moved to sell put options for TSMC. A screenshot from his Charles Schwab account reveals his intention to sell 100 contracts of TSMC put options with a strike price of $175, expiring on January 16, 2026, at a limit price of $23.2.

        "Story":"U.S. to Hold Over 20% of Advanced Semiconductor Capacity by 2030, TSMC Expands Investment to US$165 Billion, Says TrendForceTAIPEI:\u00a0TRENDFORCE has issued the following news release:\n\nTrendForce\u2019s latest findings reveal that TSMC has announced it\u2019s increasing investment in U.S. advanced semiconductor manufacturing, bringing the total to US$165 billion. Mass production is expected to begin after 2030 if the three newly planned fabs proceed on schedule. The U.S., which has been actively expanding its advanced semiconductor capacity, is projected to hold 22% of the global market share by 2030.\n\nTrendForce notes that TSMC first announced plans for its Arizona fab in 2020 as part of a six-fab expansion strategy, aiming to mitigate geopolitical risks. However, escalating trade tensions and tariff issues have forced the company to accelerate its expansion timeline.\n\nSince 2018, global trade conflicts and the COVID-19 pandemic have accelerated supply chain fragmentation, with governments worldwide striving to establish localized semiconductor production. TrendForce data from 2021 indicates that Taiwan accounted for 71% of global advanced node capacity and 53% of mature node capacity. However, by 2030, Taiwan\u2019s advanced process share is expected to decline to 58%, while its mature process share will drop to 30% as the U.S. and China ramp up their semiconductor manufacturing capabilities.\n\nExpanding U.S. investments is a strategic necessity as U.S.-based clients represent the largest share of TSMC\u2019s advanced node adoption. TSMC is also establishing two advanced packaging plants and a R&D center for HPC applications in addition to three new fabs. Arizona is set to become TSMC\u2019s leading overseas technology hub, ensuring comprehensive service for key clients.\n\nWhile expanding U.S. production reduces concentration risks, it could also lead to higher costs for U.S. IC customers. These increased expenses may trickle down to higher component and end-product prices, potentially affecting consumer purchasing behavior.\n\nTrendForce observes that TSMC\u2019s Arizona Phase 1 has just entered mass production, while Phase 2 and Phase 3 are still under construction, with mass production expected between 2026 and 2028. The actual timeline for the newly announced fabs remains uncertain, with no immediate impact on the industry in the short term. However, in the mid-to-long term, the cost implications and potential price increases across the supply chain will be key factors to watch."

Wei, anunciaron el lunes pasado desde la Casa Blanca esta nueva bater\u00eda de inversiones, encaminadas a la construcci\u00f3n de tres nuevas f\u00e1bricas, dos instalaciones de empaquetado de chips avanzados y un centro de investigaci\u00f3n y desarrollo en territorio estadounidense.\n\nEstos 100.000 millones se suman a los 65.000 millones de d\u00f3lares de inversi\u00f3n ya comprometidos por TSMC en Phoenix (Arizona), donde posee una planta que comenz\u00f3 a operar a finales de 2024 y tiene previsto abrir otras dos adicionales en los pr\u00f3ximos a\u00f1os.\n\nEn opini\u00f3n de Michael Cunningham, investigador asociado en el Centro de Estudios Asi\u00e1ticos de la Fundaci\u00f3n Heritage, un laboratorio de ideas con sede en Washington, la expansi\u00f3n de TSMC en EE.UU. no amenazar\u00e1 la posici\u00f3n dominante de Taiw\u00e1n, que \"cuenta con el cl\u00faster de semiconductores m\u00e1s completo del mundo\".\n\n\"Es posible que la proporci\u00f3n de chips producidos en Taiw\u00e1n disminuya con respecto a los niveles actuales y que la proporci\u00f3n fabricada en EE.UU. aumente, pero TSMC sigue siendo una empresa taiwanesa y el centro neur\u00e1lgico de sus operaciones permanece en Taiw\u00e1n\", subraya a EFE el experto.\n\nSeg\u00fan las \u00faltimas estimaciones de la consultora TrendForce, Taiw\u00e1n controla en torno al 66 % del mercado global de fundici\u00f3n de chips avanzados, esenciales para empresas estadounidenses como Nvidia, Apple o AMD y aplicaciones de inteligencia artificial (IA) y computaci\u00f3n de alto rendimiento.\n\nDada la concentraci\u00f3n de estas compa\u00f1\u00edas en EE.UU., era hasta cierto punto \"inevitable\" que TSMC, el mayor fabricante de chips avanzados del mundo, acabara trasladando parte de su producci\u00f3n a ese pa\u00eds, afirma Alicia Garc\u00eda-Herrero, del banco de inversi\u00f3n franc\u00e9s Natixis.\n\n\"Taiw\u00e1n sigue siendo bastante indispensable, pero menos. No creo que se pueda decir que ya no existe el 'Silicon Shield', aunque se empieza a desgastar\", aclara a EFE la economista, refiri\u00e9ndose a la idea de que la industria de semiconductores de Taiw\u00e1n y su importancia a nivel global act\u00faa como una suerte de protecci\u00f3n estrat\u00e9gica para la isla frente a un eventual ataque de China.\n\n\"Creo que es ley de vida que si tienes la IA en tus equipos m\u00e1s avanzados de seguridad y en equipamiento militar, los produzcas en tu pa\u00eds\", apunta.\n\nMientras avanza la construcci\u00f3n de estas seis nuevas instalaciones, algo que culminar\u00e1, probablemente, una vez finalizado el mandato de Trump, Estados Unidos \"seguir\u00e1 dependiendo de los semiconductores producidos en Taiw\u00e1n\", cuyo cl\u00faster industrial \"no puede ser reemplazado ni trasladado en el futuro cercano\", recalca Cunningham.\n\n\"La demanda s\u00f3lo aumentar\u00e1 a medida que la administraci\u00f3n de Trump persigue sus objetivos relacionados con la reindustrializaci\u00f3n y la inteligencia artificial, y el \u00e9xito de estos objetivos depende de que las empresas estadounidenses puedan acceder a grandes cantidades de chips a precios competitivos\", sostiene.\n\nAunque TSMC haya defendido estas inversiones desde una \u00f3ptica meramente empresarial, el Gobierno taiwan\u00e9s tambi\u00e9n busca acercar posturas con Donald Trump, quien amenaz\u00f3 con imponer aranceles de hasta un 100 % a los chips taiwaneses y acus\u00f3 en varias ocasiones a la isla de \"robar\" la industria de semiconductores de Estados Unidos.\n\n\"Claramente es una respuesta a la presi\u00f3n de Trump para que se produzcan m\u00e1s semiconductores avanzados en Estados Unidos y tambi\u00e9n, sinceramente, que el Gobierno de Taiw\u00e1n ha puesto presi\u00f3n, porque est\u00e1 en juego que haya aranceles sobre semiconductores que perjudicar\u00edan a TSMC y al resto de la industria\", dice Garc\u00eda-Herrero.\n\nPara Cunningham, este movimiento se entiende \"principalmente desde una perspectiva pol\u00edtica\", puesto que desde el punto de vista del coste, la calidad y la eficiencia \"tendr\u00eda m\u00e1s sentido tanto para TSMC como para sus clientes estadounidenses seguir apostando por la fabricaci\u00f3n en Taiw\u00e1n\".\n\n\"La presi\u00f3n para que los fabricantes de chips de Taiw\u00e1n trasladen su producci\u00f3n a EE.UU. no comenz\u00f3 con Trump y probablemente no terminar\u00e1 cuando abandone el cargo.

        "Story":"Taiwan to maintain its chip foundry leadership despite TSMC expansion in the U.S.Javier Castro Bugar\u00edn\n\nTaipei, Mar 8 (EFE) - Taiwan will maintain its global leadership in chip manufacturing despite TSMC's expansion in the United States, according to experts consulted by EFE, who interpret the technology company's $100 billion investment in the US as a gesture of goodwill towards Donald Trump.\n\nThe Republican president and TSMC's CEO, C.C. Wei, announced last Monday from the White House this new battery of investments, aimed at the construction of three new factories, two advanced chip packaging facilities and a research and development center in U.S. territory.\n\nThis $100 billion is in addition to the $65 billion investment already committed by TSMC in Phoenix (Arizona), where it has a plant that began operating at the end of 2024 and plans to open two additional plants in the coming years.\n\nIn the view of Michael Cunningham, a research associate at the Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center, a Washington-based think tank, TSMC's U.S. expansion will not threaten the dominant position of Taiwan, which \"has the most complete semiconductor cluster in the world.\"\n\n\"It is possible that the proportion of chips produced in Taiwan will decrease from current levels and that the proportion manufactured in the U.S. will increase, but TSMC remains a Taiwanese company and the nerve center of its operations remains in Taiwan,\" the expert stressed to EFE.\n\nAccording to the latest estimates by the consulting firm TrendForce, Taiwan controls around 66% of the global market for advanced chip foundry, essential for US companies such as Nvidia, Apple or AMD and artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing applications.\n\nGiven the concentration of these companies in the U.S., it was to some extent \"inevitable\" that TSMC, the world's largest advanced chipmaker, would eventually move some of its production there, says Alicia Garcia-Herrero of French investment bank Natixis.\n\n\"Taiwan is still pretty indispensable, but less so. I don't think it can be said that the 'Silicon Shield' no longer exists, although it is beginning to wear out,\" the economist told EFE, referring to the idea that Taiwan's semiconductor industry and its global importance act as a kind of strategic protection for the island against a possible attack from China.\n\n\"I think it's a law of life that if you have AI in your most advanced security and military equipment, you produce it in your country,\" he notes.\n\nAs construction of these six new facilities progresses, something that will culminate, most likely, after Trump's term ends, the United States \"will continue to rely on semiconductors produced in Taiwan,\" whose industrial cluster \"cannot be replaced or relocated in the near future,\" Cunningham stresses.\n\n\"Demand will only increase as the Trump administration pursues its goals related to reindustrialization and artificial intelligence, and the success of these goals depends on U.S. companies being able to access large quantities of chips at competitive prices,\" he argues.\n\nAlthough TSMC has defended these investments from a purely business perspective, the Taiwanese government is also seeking to bring closer positions with Donald Trump, who threatened to impose tariffs of up to 100% on Taiwanese chips and repeatedly accused the island of \"stealing\" the US semiconductor industry.\n\n\"Clearly it's a response to Trump's push for more advanced semiconductors to be produced in the U.S. and also, frankly, that the Taiwanese government has put pressure, because there are tariffs on semiconductors at stake that would hurt TSMC and the rest of the industry,\" Garcia-Herrero says.\n\nFor Cunningham, this move is understood \"mainly from a political perspective,\" since from a cost, quality and efficiency standpoint \"it would make more sense for both TSMC and its U.S. customers to continue to bet on manufacturing in Taiwan.\"\n\n\"The push for Taiwan chipmakers to move production to the U.S. didn't start with Trump and likely won't end when he leaves office. TSMC's announcement reflects its leaders' recognition of this uncomfortable political reality, which they hope to manage by showing the U.S. government and people that they are actively contributing to his priorities,\" the researcher sentences.

        "Story":"Chipmaker, Taiwan say deal in US not forcedTAIPEI, Taiwan - Taiwan's president and top chipmaker TSMC held a joint news conference Thursday to defend the company's decision to invest $100 billion more in the U.S., saying it stemmed from customer demand and not pressure from the Trump administration.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's largest chipmaker, said this week it would invest $100 billion in three more chip manufacturing plants, along with two packaging facilities in Arizona. Monday's announcement is on top of the $65 billion already invested in the U.S.\n\nThe decision sparked concerns that Taiwan would gain little in return for moving some of its most advanced manufacturing processes to the U.S.\n\nTaiwan President Lai Ching-te denied that TSMC's investment decision was due to political pressure by the United States. President Donald Trump had previously said that Taiwan had taken away the U.S. chip business and that he wanted it back.\n\n\"TSMC's decision is necessary for its future development. The government did not face pressure from the United States during TSMC's investment process in the U.S.,\" Lai said Thursday.\n\nTSMC CEO C.C. Wei said that he had spoken with the firm's customers and realized that TSMC's current expansion plans in the U.S. were insufficient to meet current demand. \"Customer demand has been steadily increasing. For TSMC, our investment plans are based on customer needs, and we are very cautious,\" Wei said, adding: \"The amount of investment in the U.S. may seem large, but it is still not enough to meet demand.\"\n\nHe also said development in the U.S. would not affect TSMC's plans in Taiwan."

        "Story":"Taiwan economist says TSMC can adapt if US cuts fundingA Taiwanese economist believes TSMC could handle the impact if the US cuts subsidies for its operations in America.\n\nTaiwan Industry Economics Services Industrial Economic Database Director Liu Pei-chen told CNA on Thursday that impacts of subsidy cuts would be within a controllable range for TSMC. She said the company could pass funding shortfalls on to customers due to its technological advantage.\n\nLiu noted that TSMC committed to investing NT$2.14 trillion (US$65 billion) in its US operations before announcing a further NT$3.29 trillion on Monday. She said the US committed to providing about NT$217 billion in subsidies, which amounts to about 10% of the initial investment.\n\nLiu said the impacts would be greater for other semiconductor manufacturers like Intel, Samsung, and Taiwan's GlobalWafers.\n\nDigitimes Senior Analyst Chen Chih-chia said on Wednesday that Intel's recent US expansion required substantial investment and the company relies on US government subsidies. Chen noted Intel recently extended the schedule of a factory construction project in Ohio based on the possible termination of subsidies.\n\nLiu said America's credibility as an investment destination will be damaged if US President Donald Trump cuts the subsidies promised during the Biden administration. Despite that, she said Trump's tariffs may achieve his goal of bringing more semiconductor manufacturing to the US, though further observation is needed.\n\nTrump said on Tuesday that the US should remove the CHIPS Act and use funds allocated to it to reduce debt. The act passed in 2022 and allocated grants for more than 20 companies to encourage semiconductor production in the US, with TSMC being one of the largest recipients."

Ltd. (Hsinchu, Taiwan) has been issued patent number 12230554, according to news reporting originating out of Alexandria, Virginia, by NewsRx editors.\n\nThe patent's inventors are Kao, Min-Feng (Chiayi, TW), Lin, Hsing-Chih (Tainan, TW), Liu, Jen-Cheng (Hsin-Chu, TW), Tsai, Wei-Tao (Tainan, TW), Yaung, Dun-Nian (Taipei, TW).\n\nThis patent was filed on July 27, 2023 and was published online on February 18, 2025.\n\nFrom the background information supplied by the inventors, news correspondents obtained the following quote: \"The semiconductor manufacturing industry has continually improved the processing capabilities and power consumption of integrated circuits (ICs) by shrinking the minimum feature size. However, in recent years, process limitations have made it difficult to continue shrinking the minimum feature size. The stacking of two-dimensional (2D) ICs into three-dimensional (3D) ICs has emerged as a potential approach to continue improving processing capabilities and power consumption of ICs. Through substrate vias (TSVs) are one of the technologies that have enabled the stacking of 2D ICs into 3D ICs.\"\n\nSupplementing the background information on this patent, NewsRx reporters also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: \"The present disclosure provides many different embodiments, or examples, for implementing different features of this disclosure. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. For example, the formation of a first feature over or on a second feature in the description that follows may include embodiments in which the first and second features are formed in direct contact, and may also include embodiments in which additional features may be formed between the first and second features, such that the first and second features may not be in direct contact. In addition, the present disclosure may repeat reference numerals and\/or letters in the various examples. This repetition is for the purpose of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and\/or configurations discussed.\n\n\"Further, spatially relative terms, such as \"beneath,\" \"below,\" \"lower,\" \"above,\" \"upper\" and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. The spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. The apparatus may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein may likewise be interpreted accordingly.\n\n\"In some embodiments, an integrated circuit (IC) comprises a substrate, an interconnect structure, and a semiconductor device. The semiconductor device is on a frontside of the substrate and is partially defined by the substrate. The interconnect structure covers and electrically couples to the semiconductor device on the frontside of the substrate and comprises a wire. The IC further comprise a through substrate via (TSV) extending through the substrate, from a backside of the substrate to the wire. The TSV may, for example, facilitate electrical coupling of the interconnect structure to a pad on the backside of the substrate, to another IC on the backside, or some other structure on the backside.\n\n\"During formation of the TSV, a plasma etch is performed into the backside of the substrate to form a via opening extending through the substrate. Plasma etching is employed because it may be highly directional and may hence form the TSV opening with an anisotropic etch profile. However, the plasma etch introduces charge into the substrate by way of free radicals. Depending upon proximity of the TSV opening and hence the TSV to the semiconductor device, the charge may migrate to the semiconductor device and become trapped in shallow trench isolation (STI) structures at the semiconductor device. For example, the STI structures may have silicon nitride liners that trap the charge at the STI structures. The trapped charge may, in turn, attract charge carriers at the semiconductor device and shift operating parameters of the semiconductor device out of specification. For example, the trapped charge and\/or the attracted charge carriers may decrease a saturation current I sat of the semiconductor device by about 15%-17%, or by some other suitable value, when the semiconductor device is a high voltage N-channel metal-oxide-semiconductor (HV NMOS) device.\n\n\"Various embodiments of the present application are directed towards an IC in which a shield structure blocks the migration of charge to a semiconductor device from proximate a TSV. In some embodiments, the IC comprises a substrate, an interconnect structure, the semiconductor device, the TSV, and the shield structure. The interconnect structure is on a frontside of the substrate and comprises a wire. The semiconductor device is on the frontside of the substrate, between the substrate and the interconnect structure. The TSV extends completely through the substrate, from a backside of the substrate to the wire, and comprises metal. The shield structure comprises a PN junction extending completely through the substrate and directly between the semiconductor device and the TSV.\"\n\nThe claims supplied by the inventors are:\n\n\"1. An integrated circuit (IC) comprising: a semiconductor substrate; a semiconductor device on and partially defined by the semiconductor substrate; a through substrate via (TSV) extending through the semiconductor substrate; and a semiconductor shield structure extending completely through the semiconductor substrate, wherein the semiconductor shield structure is between the semiconductor device and the TSV and confines free radicals at the TSV to between the TSV and the semiconductor shield structure.\n\n\"2.

Often this electroplating process serves as a step in the damascene fabrication procedure.\n\n\"For example, wafers are inserted in a substrate holder and then immersed into an electroplating bath to perform the electroplating process. After the electroplating process is completed, the wafers are removed from the electroplating bath. However, after electroplating of several batches of wafers, contamination is found on the substrate holder, which may induce inline gap-filling defects during the electroplating process, and thus to deteriorate the process yield. What is needed therefore is improved technology for removing the contamination on the substrate holder.\"\n\nSupplementing the background information on this patent, NewsRx reporters also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: \"The following disclosure provides many different embodiments, or examples, for implementing different features of the provided subject matter. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. For example, the formation of a first feature over or on a second feature in the description that follows may include embodiments in which the first and second features are formed in direct contact, and may also include embodiments in which additional features may be formed between the first and second features, such that the first and second features may not be in direct contact. In addition, the present disclosure may repeat reference numerals and\/or letters in the various examples. This repetition is for the purpose of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and\/or configurations discussed.\n\n\"Further, spatially relative terms, such as \"beneath,\" \"below,\" \"lower,\" \"above,\" \"upper\" and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. The spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. The apparatus may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein may likewise be interpreted accordingly.\n\n\"Electrochemical deposition may be employed at various points in the integrated circuit fabrication and packaging processes. At the integrated circuit (IC) chip level, damascene features are created through electrodepositing copper within vias and trenches to form multiple interconnected metallization layers. However, after electrochemical deposition is performed on several batches of wafers, contamination is found on the substrate holder, which may induce inline gap-filling defects during the electrochemical deposition, and thus to deteriorate the process yield. Specifically, the contamination may be dropped into the vias or the trenches, which may result in the gap-filling defects. The contamination may be particles, unwanted deposits, recrystallized components (e.g., copper sulfate or a mixture of copper sulfate and additive) or other materials. What is needed therefore is improved technology for removing the contamination on the substrate holder.\n\n\"Currently, the substrate holder is cleaned by immersing the substrate holder into the electroplating bath to remove the contamination on the substrate holder. Nevertheless, such cleaning process typically takes more than ten minutes. Furthermore, the cleaning process may be performed with high frequency, and thus will significantly lower wafer throughput per hour (WPH).\n\n\"Therefore, the present disclosure provides a cleaning device for effectively removing contamination on a substrate holder used with an electroplating cell. In some embodiments, the cleaning process using the cleaning device takes less than or much less than ten minutes, and thus will improve the wafer throughput per hour (WPH). Embodiments of the electroplating cell, the substrate holder and the cleaning device are sequentially described in detail below.\"\n\nThe claims supplied by the inventors are:\n\n\"1.

        "Story":"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing- 6 Reasons Traders Remain Bearish (and 1 Reason Why Bullish)GLOBAL ROUND UP\n\nADRS AND DEPOSITORY RECEIPTS\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (N:TSM), the International Depository Receipt (IDR) market's largest Semiconductors company by market cap, has sunk 11.0% Year To Date. There is uncertainty in the market and it is difficult to predict how economic conditions will be in 2026 and beyond as well as what the impact of those conditions may be on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. However, there are several key reasons why some investors remain bearish on the short-term prospects for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.\n\nBelow are some of those key reasons:\n\n- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's ADR price has sank 4.6% from its previous trading session to close at $175.85.\n\n- Bearish Kicker Candlestick chart pattern: A Bearish Kicker Candlestick Chart pattern is one of the most reliable reversal patterns formed at the end of an uptrend, when it encounters resistance in an overbought area.\n\n- Short-Term Technical Ranking 1 out of 5 [5 is best]: ADRs are scored on a set of technical parameters reflecting price performance, overbought\/ oversold levels and trading volumes. They are ranked according to the bullish\/bearish values of those parameters. The highest ranking is 5 and the lowest ranking is 1.\n\n- The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator of 12-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of 186.3 minus the 26-day EMA of 193.6 is negative, suggesting a bearish signal. The price to 50-day EMAP ratio is 0.9, a bearish indicator.\n\n- Both the 12-day EMA as well as the 26-day EMA are falling.\n\n- The ADR is down in last 5 days 2.9% and 13.8% for past month.\n\nHowever, there is at least one reason investors may remain bullish in the short-term:\n\n- The ADR is trading above both its MAPs and the 50-day MAP of 197.7 is higher than the 200-day MAP of 176.4, a bullish indicator.\n\nTAIWAN SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING (TSM) ADR Dashboard End-of-Day Thu, Mar 06\n\nhttp:\/\/www.tsmc.com.tw\n\nLast                              $175.85                                                            \n52-Week Price Range               $124.52 - $226.40                                                  \nAve Daily Volume                  16,114,558 ADRs                                                    \nToday's Volume [VI]               17,706,202 [1.1]                                                   \nMarket Cap                        $913 billion                                                       \nExchange                          INTERNATIONAL DEPOSITORY RECEIPTS [Frankfurt, USNYSE, Stuttgart]   \nEPS (FY2023)                      $32.34                                                             \nEPS Growth (Q3 2024 vs Q2 2024)   31.3                                                               \nShares Outstanding                5,190,000,000                                                      \nInstitutional Ownership           % of shares outstanding 16%                                        \nTSM in Indices                    BNY Mellon Composite ADR [of 194 stocks]                           \nSector                            Semiconductors [Rank by MCap 1 of 20 stocks]                       \nPV$1000 (1 yr) and TRS            $1,277; 27.7%                                                      \n\nVI* Volume Index = Number of shares traded today\/Average number of shares traded per day.\n\nA year ago the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing adr price was $139.60. $1,000 would have bought 7.2 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing adrs on that day.

        "Story":"Intel embraces the multi-foundry approach, currently outsourcing 30% of its wafer production to TSMCMar 07, 2025\n\nIn a nutshell:Intel's decision to maintain a multi-foundry approach reflects the practical necessities of collaborating with external suppliers. While the company remains committed to achieving fabrication self-sufficiency one day, this goal is now balanced against product competitiveness and time-to-market considerations.\n\nIntel's semiconductor manufacturing strategy has undergone drastic changes over the past few years, reflecting both historical trends in the industry and the company's shifting priorities. Once committed to eliminating its reliance on external foundries \u2013 a goal rooted in its long-standing identity as an integrated device manufacturer (IDM) \u2013 Intel has now embraced a permanent multi-foundry approach, outsourcing approximately 30 percent of its wafer production to TSMC.\n\nAccording to Intel's VP of Investor Relations, John Pitzer, the company now views TSMC as a valuable supplier that fosters healthy competition with Intel's own foundry operations. During a recent investor dialogue with Morgan Stanley analyst Joe Moore, Pitzer said that this partnership is seen as beneficial for maintaining product competitiveness and ensuring strategic flexibility.\n\n\"... to the extent that I think a year ago, we were talking about trying to get that to zero as quickly as possible. That's no longer the strategy. We think it's always good to have at least some of our wafers with TSMC. They're a great supplier. It creates a good competition between them and Intel Foundry.\n\nNot quite sure what the right sort of level set is. Is it 20? Is it 15? We're working through that. But we will use, I think, external foundry suppliers longer kind of under this new strategy.\" - John Pitzer, Intel's VP for Investor Relations.\n\nThis shift in strategy coincides with leadership changes at Intel, where interim CEOs Dave Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus have been granted more decision-making authority. Holthaus likely has more authority to extend Intel's reliance on TSMC and use it for a broader range of products than she might have six or nine months ago, Pitzer said.\n\nNow, the company is evaluating an optimal outsourcing ratio, targeting between 15 percent and 20 percent of total wafer production \u2013 a level that would allow it to leverage external expertise without undermining its IDM model.\n\nBy relying on TSMC's mature 3nm and 2nm nodes for critical products such as Arrow Lake processors, Intel ensures high-quality production while advancing innovations like Foveros 3D packaging technology.\n\nThe executive team is focusing on enhancing Intel's product competitiveness before fully optimizing its foundry operations. Holthaus has also been given more agency to make decisions regarding the product roadmap and strategies for increasing market share.\n\nFor Intel, partnering with TSMC ensures access to advanced technologies and positions it competitively against rivals like AMD and Nvidia, which rely heavily on external foundries, all while working on potentially becoming a foundry provider for those same competitors in the longer term.\n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

        "Story":"TSMC Invests $100 Billion in U.S. Chipmaking Facilities to Meet Growing AI DemandIndia\n\nIndia, March 7 -- TSMC's Landmark $100 Billion U.S. Investment\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world's leading contract chipmaker, has committed $100 billion to expand its chipmaking facilities in the United States. This strategic move aims to boost semiconductor production amid increasing global demand for AI chips and growing trade tensions between the U.S. and China.\n\nTSMC's U.S. Expansion Plans\n\nAs part of the investment, TSMC will build three advanced chip fabrication plants and two packaging facilities in Arizona, along with a state-of-the-art research and development center focused on cutting-edge AI chip production.\n\n\"This expansion is necessary to meet rising customer demand and will not impact TSMC's operations in Taiwan.\" - C.C. Wei, CEO of TSMC\n\nCEO C.C. Wei clarified that this expansion is driven by customer demand rather than political pressure, emphasizing, \"The expansion is necessary to meet the rising demand and will not impact TSMC's operations in Taiwan.\"\n\nWhy TSMC is Investing in U.S. Chip Manufacturing\n\nThe move aligns with U.S. efforts to localize semiconductor production and reduce reliance on Asian supply chains. It also ensures TSMC stays ahead of competitors like Samsung and Intel in the AI chip industry. However, higher labor and operational costs in the U.S. remain a concern.\n\nImpact on Taiwan's Silicon Shield\n\nWhile Taiwan remains TSMC's primary manufacturing hub, the investment has raised concerns about the island's \"silicon shield\"-its dominance in the global semiconductor industry. Taiwanese officials, however, assure that TSMC's core operations will remain in Taiwan.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWith this historic $100 billion investment, TSMC solidifies its leadership in semiconductor innovation, supports U.S. chip independence, and drives the future of AI computing.

        "Story":"TSMC (TSM) Expands U.S. Investment Amid Strong AI DemandMar 07, 2025\n\nMorgan Stanley recently reaffirmed its overweight rating on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) (TSM, Financial) following a discussion with its CFO, Wendell Huang. The bank suggests taking advantage of the recent stock price dip to increase holdings. The conversation focused on TSMC's additional $100 billion capital expenditure in the U.S., potential impacts on profit margins, sustainable AI demand, and the joint venture with Intel.\n\nTSMC announced a $100 billion investment in the U.S., including plans to build three more semiconductor plants, two advanced packaging plants, and a research center. The company is expanding its Arizona facilities, with the first phase already achieving high-yield production. Future phases are being accelerated, and TSMC remains committed to investing in Taiwan, although U.S. capacity will grow.\n\nTSMC anticipates a 2%-3% reduction in profit margins over the next five years due to overseas expansion, including the U.S. investment. The company is negotiating with U.S. clients to share production costs due to higher local expenses. As production scales up and the ecosystem improves, costs are expected to decline, potentially maintaining a long-term gross margin of 53% or higher.\n\nDespite ruling out acquiring wafer fabs, TSMC is open to shareholder-beneficial options. The U.S. operations may demand significant management and human resources. AI demand remains robust, with TSMC planning to double its CoWoS capacity by 2025, reflecting flexible customer demand.\n\nTSMC forecasts a near 20% revenue CAGR over the next five years, with cloud AI semiconductors driving growth at nearly 40% CAGR. While non-cloud AI business growth may be modest, increased semiconductor content in smartphones, GPUs, and IoT devices is anticipated.\n\nThe company plans to establish two advanced packaging plants in Arizona and is considering the location for its U.S. R&D center. TSMC received a $1.5 billion subsidy from the CHIPS Act in 2024, with future subsidies dependent on U.S. policies.\n\nFor new process nodes, initial production in Taiwan is deemed most efficient, minimizing the time required to introduce new technologies to U.S. fabs. TSMC maintains a competitive edge in technology, particularly in high-NA EUV lithography.\n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Seus coment\u00e1rios foram feitos poucos dias depois de a TSMC ter prometido um investimento adicional de US$ 100 bilh\u00f5es nos EUA, aumentando a capacidade no pa\u00eds em um movimento destinado a apaziguar Trump e evitar as tarifas que ele est\u00e1 amea\u00e7ando sobre as importa\u00e7\u00f5es de chips.Um dia depois, Trump pediu ao Congresso que eliminasse a Lei de Chips dos EUA, segundo a qual o governo Biden concordou em apoiar o investimento de US$ 65 bilh\u00f5es prometido anteriormente pela TSMC com US$ 6,6 bilh\u00f5es em fundos p\u00fablicos.

Na quinta-feira, o chefe da TSMC se esquivou de uma pergunta sobre se a empresa havia recebido uma garantia de Trump de que os subs\u00eddios permaneceriam em vigor em troca de seu compromisso adicional. Ele acrescentou que a \"grande parceria\" da TSMC com todas as outras partes da cadeia de fornecimento de chips e seu foco exclusivo nas necessidades de seus clientes, em vez do apoio do governo, foram as raz\u00f5es pelas quais ela superou os rivais.A coletiva de imprensa conjunta com o presidente de Taiwan teve como objetivo dissipar os temores de que os investimentos adicionais da TSMC nos EUA prejudicariam o compromisso da empresa com a na\u00e7\u00e3o asi\u00e1tica. Em seu pa\u00eds, a TSMC \u00e9 amplamente chamada de \"montanha sagrada que protege a na\u00e7\u00e3o\", refletindo a cren\u00e7a de que outras democracias estar\u00e3o mais dispostas a defender Taiwan contra um poss\u00edvel ataque chin\u00eas, desde que continuem fortemente dependentes dos suprimentos de chips do pa\u00eds. A empresa produz mais de 90% dos semicondutores mais avan\u00e7ados do mundo, todos produzidos em f\u00e1bricas em seu pa\u00eds de origem, mas planeja come\u00e7ar a oferecer a tecnologia de processo mais avan\u00e7ada nos Estados Unidos a partir de 2028.De acordo com o novo acordo anunciado com Trump na segunda-feira, a empresa aumentou drasticamente seus planos de expans\u00e3o de capacidade nos EUA e at\u00e9 mesmo se comprometeu a estabelecer uma unidade de pesquisa e desenvolvimento nos EUA, algo a que havia resistido anteriormente. Esse modelo permite que outros fabricantes abandonem a produ\u00e7\u00e3o e se concentrem no design, o que, por sua vez, d\u00e1 \u00e0 TSMC uma participa\u00e7\u00e3o de mercado cada vez maior.Wei observou que o novo investimento da TSMC nos EUA n\u00e3o ser\u00e1 feito \u00e0s custas de seu pa\u00eds de origem. A empresa est\u00e1 construindo 11 novas f\u00e1bricas em Taiwan, em compara\u00e7\u00e3o com as cinco novas f\u00e1bricas nos pr\u00f3ximos quatro anos prometidas a Trump.O chefe da TSMC esclareceu que a unidade de pesquisa e desenvolvimento nos EUA se concentrar\u00e1 no aprimoramento da tecnologia de processo que j\u00e1 entrou em produ\u00e7\u00e3o. A \"verdadeira pesquisa e desenvolvimento\" para impulsionar a tecnologia de fabrica\u00e7\u00e3o da pr\u00f3xima gera\u00e7\u00e3o permanecer\u00e1 no centro global de pesquisa e desenvolvimento em Taiwan, dez vezes maior do que a unidade dos EUA, com 10.000 engenheiros."

        "Story":"TSMC, sin miedo a perder subsidios de WashingtonTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) asegur\u00f3 que \"no tiene miedo\" de perder los subsidios de Washington para sus enormes inversiones en Estados Unidos, mientras el jefe del fabricante de chips m\u00e1s grande del mundo buscaba tranquilizar a los inversionistas tras el llamado del presidente Donald Trump para eliminar la ley de chips de 52 mil millones de d\u00f3lares.\"Incluso si no recibimos ning\u00fan subsidio, no tenemos miedo de eso\", dijo el presidente y director ejecutivo de TSMC, C. C. Wei, en una conferencia de prensa conjunta con el presidente de Taiw\u00e1n, Lai Ching-te. \"Honestamente, solo exijo imparcialidad. No tenemos miedo de competir\", agreg\u00f3.Sus comentarios se producen apenas unos d\u00edas despu\u00e9s de que TSMC hizo la promesa de una inversi\u00f3n adicional de 100 mil millones de d\u00f3lares en EU, aumentando la capacidad en el pa\u00eds en una medida dise\u00f1ada para apaciguar a Trump y evitar los aranceles con los que amenaza a las importaciones de chips.Un d\u00eda despu\u00e9s, Trump pidi\u00f3 al Congreso que eliminara la Ley de Chips de EU, en virtud de la cual la administraci\u00f3n Biden acord\u00f3 apoyar las inversiones de 65 mil millones de d\u00f3lares previamente prometidas por TSMC con 6 mil 600 millones de d\u00f3lares en fondos p\u00fablicos.En su mensaje a la naci\u00f3n la noche del martes, Trump dijo sobre TSMC que \"todo lo que les importaba era que no quer\u00edan pagar los aranceles\". A\u00f1adi\u00f3: \"As\u00ed que vinieron y est\u00e1n construyendo\u2026 no tenemos que darles dinero\".El jueves, el jefe de TSMC eludi\u00f3 la pregunta acerca de si la compa\u00f1\u00eda hab\u00eda recibido una garant\u00eda de Trump de que los subsidios permanecer\u00edan vigentes a cambio de su compromiso adicional.A\u00f1adi\u00f3 que la \"gran alianza\" de TSMC con todas las dem\u00e1s partes de la cadena de suministro de chips y su enfoque \u00fanico en las necesidades de sus clientes, en lugar del apoyo del gobierno, fueron las razones por las que super\u00f3 a sus rivales.La conferencia de prensa conjunta con el presidente de Taiw\u00e1n ten\u00eda como objetivo disipar los temores de que las inversiones estadunidenses adicionales de TSMC iban a socavar el compromiso de la empresa con la naci\u00f3n asi\u00e1tica.En casa, a TSMC se le conoce ampliamente como la \"monta\u00f1a sagrada que protege a la naci\u00f3n\", lo que refleja la creencia de que otras democracias estar\u00e1n m\u00e1s dispuestas a defender a Taiw\u00e1n contra un posible ataque chino mientras sigan dependiendo en gran medida de los suministros de chips del pa\u00eds. La compa\u00f1\u00eda produce m\u00e1s de 90 por ciento de los semiconductores m\u00e1s avanzados del mundo.Hasta ahora, todos estos chips se fabrican en plantas de fabricaci\u00f3n en su pa\u00eds de origen, pero planea comenzar a ofrecer la tecnolog\u00eda de proceso m\u00e1s avanzada en Estados Unidos a partir de 2028.En virtud del nuevo acuerdo anunciado con Trump el lunes, la compa\u00f1\u00eda aument\u00f3 marcadamente sus planes de expansi\u00f3n de capacidad para Estados Unidos e incluso se comprometi\u00f3 a establecer una unidad de investigaci\u00f3n y desarrollo en ese pa\u00eds, algo a lo que se hab\u00eda resistido con anterioridad.A diferencia de los competidores Samsunge Intel, TSMC solo fabrica chips seg\u00fan los dise\u00f1os de otras empresas. Este modelo le permite a otros fabricantes abandonar la producci\u00f3n y centrar la atenci\u00f3n en el dise\u00f1o, lo que a su vez le da a TSMC una participaci\u00f3n de mercado en continuo crecimiento.Wei se\u00f1al\u00f3 que la nueva inversi\u00f3n estadunidense de TSMC no se producir\u00e1 a expensas de su pa\u00eds de origen. La compa\u00f1\u00eda est\u00e1 construyendo 11 nuevas f\u00e1bricas en Taiw\u00e1n, en comparaci\u00f3n con las cinco nuevas plantas en los pr\u00f3ximos cuatro a\u00f1os prometidas a Trump.El jefe de TSMC aclar\u00f3 que la unidad de investigaci\u00f3n y desarrollo en Estados Unidos se va a enfocar en mejorar la tecnolog\u00eda de proceso que ya entr\u00f3 en producci\u00f3n. La \"verdadera investigaci\u00f3n y desarrollo\" para impulsar tecnolog\u00eda de fabricaci\u00f3n de pr\u00f3xima generaci\u00f3n va a permanecer en el centro global de investigaci\u00f3n y desarrollo en Taiw\u00e1n, diez veces m\u00e1s grande que la unidad estadunidense, con 10 mil ingenieros."

        "Headline":"TSMC, not afraid of losing Washington subsidies",
        "Story":"TSMC, not afraid of losing Washington subsidiesTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) assured that it is \"not afraid\" of losing subsidies from Washington for its huge investments in the United States, as the head of the world's largest chipmaker sought to reassure investors following President Donald Trump's call to eliminate the $52 billion chip bill.\"Even if we don't receive any subsidies, we are not afraid of that,\" TSMC Chairman and CEO C. C. Wei said at a joint press conference with Taiwan President Lai Ching-te. \"Honestly, I just demand fairness. We are not afraid to compete,\" he added.His comments come just days after TSMC made a pledge of an additional $100 billion investment in the U.S., increasing capacity in the country in a move designed to appease Trump and avoid the tariffs he is threatening on chip imports.A day later, Trump called on Congress to kill the USA Chips Act, under which the Biden administration agreed to support TSMC's previously pledged $65 billion investment with $6.6 billion in public funds.In his message to the nation Tuesday night, Trump said of TSMC that \"all they cared about was that they didn't want to pay the tariffs.\" He added: \"So they came and they're building...we don't have to give them money. \"On Thursday, TSMC's chief sidestepped a question about whether the company had received a guarantee from Trump that subsidies would remain in place in exchange for its additional commitment.He added that TSMC's \"great partnership\" with all other parties in the chip supply chain and its unique focus on the needs of its customers, rather than government support, were the reasons it outperformed rivals.The joint press conference with Taiwan's president was aimed at allaying fears that TSMC's additional U.S. investments would undermine the company's commitment to the Asian nation.At home, TSMC is widely referred to as the \"sacred mountain that protects the nation,\" reflecting the belief that other democracies will be more willing to defend Taiwan against a potential Chinese attack as long as they remain heavily dependent on the country's chip supplies. The company produces more than 90 percent of the world's most advanced semiconductors.So far, all of these chips are manufactured in fabrication plants in its home country, but it plans to begin offering the most advanced process technology in the United States starting in 2028.Under the new agreement announced with Trump on Monday, the company sharply increased its U.S. capacity expansion plans and even committed to establishing a research and development unit there, something it had previously resisted.Unlike competitors Samsunge Intel, TSMC only makes chips to other companies' designs. This model allows other manufacturers to abandon production and focus on design, which in turn gives TSMC a steadily growing market share.Wei noted that TSMC's new U.S. investment will not come at the expense of its home country. The company is building 11 new factories in Taiwan, compared to the five new plants over the next four years promised to Trump.The TSMC chief clarified that the U.S. research and development unit is going to focus on improving the process technology that already went into production. The \"real research and development\" to drive next-generation manufacturing technology will remain at the global R&D center in Taiwan, ten times the size of the U.S. unit, with 10,000 engineers."

        "Story":"Lai Ching-te denies US pressured Taiwan over TSMC investment dealThe government did not face any pressure from the US regarding TSMC's investment deal in Arizona, President Lai Ching-te said at a press conference on Thursday.\n\nTSMC announced on Monday it will invest another NT$3.29 trillion (US$100 billion) to build three more chip fabs, two advanced packaging facilities, and an R and D center built in Arizona.\n\nTSMC CEO C.C. Wei has already explained the company's strategic expansion is necessary for its future growth, the president said.\n\nLai thanked Wei for updating the government about TSMC's investment plans in the US. He said every strategic move by TSMC enhances its competitiveness and creates opportunities for Taiwanese suppliers to expand internationally. This fosters greater economic growth for Taiwan, he added.\n\nLai said that even with three new fabs abroad and the completion of 11 fabs in Taiwan, it would still be insufficient to meet customer needs.\n\nThe president reaffirmed the government's commitment to fully support TSMC's domestic expansion by ensuring it has the land, water, electricity, manpower, and talent required.\n\nTSMC has already finished one of three planned fabs in Arizona. It employs more than 3,000 people on 1,100 acres of land and has been operating since late 2024."

The announcement at the weekend that TSMC would build three more fabs in Arizona on top of the three it had previously announced, caused a few worries in Taiwan which has always seen TSMC's chip manufacturing excellence as a shield against Chinese aggression.\n\nThe thinking seems to be that while Taiwan is the repository of the world's best semiconductor manufacturing technology, America will have more skin in the game if it comes to any attempts by China to take over the island by force.\n\nTSMC has always assured Taiwan that it will keep the latest technology in Taiwan and that its foreign fabs in Europe, Japan and America, although advanced, would not be the most advanced of its fab stable. The most advanced would be kept in Taiwan and this would constitute Taiwan's 'Silicon Shield'.\n\nEarlier this week, the leader of the opposition KMT party in Taiwan, Fu Kun-chi, asked: \"Where is Taiwan's national security if TSMC become ASMC (American Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) and the sacred mountain that protects the country is gone?\"\n\nTo assuage local  fears that TSMC's latest $100 billion investment in Arizona  would include putting leading-edge fans in the USA, Taiwan's presidential office spokesman Karen Kuo stated that TSMC \"will keep its most advanced manufacturing processes in Taiwan\".\n\nMs Kuo said the Arizona investment still needed Taiwan government approval and cited the Industrial Innovation Act and said the companies must obtain approval from the government for foreign investments above $45.5 million.\n\nTSMC CEO C C Wei said yesterday that expanding investment in the US was because its US capacity is fully booked for this year and the next two years.\n\nWei added that while TSMC would be building three new fabs in the US, it would be building 11 new fabs in Taiwan.\n\nThe post What If TSMC becomes ASMC?

Section: General News - SECRETARY LUTNICK: So, I'm thrilled to be here today, because President Trump has made it a fundamental objective to bring semiconductor chip manufacturing home to America.\n\nUnder the Biden administration, TSMC received a $6 billion grant, and that encouraged them to build $65 billion. So, America gave TSMC 10 percent of the money to build here. And now you're seeing the power of Donald Trump's presidency, because TSMC, the greatest manufacturer of chips in the world, is coming to America with a $100 billion investment. And, of course, that is backed by the fact that they can come here because they can avoid paying tariffs.\n\nSo, the idea is: Come to America. Build greatness in America. Build for the American customers - the Apple, Nvidia, that whole list that Chairman Wei gave - in order to bring production to America.\n\nSo, we're really, really excited. This continues the most incredible path you've ever seen, in these first weeks and months of the Trump administration, of incredible manufacturing coming to America. The keys that the president has called out are coming here. They're coming here in huge size because they want to be in the greatest market in the world, and they want to avoid the tariffs that, if they're not here, they'd have to suffer.\n\nSo, I want to congratulate C.C. Wei for bringing in this incredible $100 billion investment, but it's on the shoulders of our president, Donald Trump, which is why he's coming.\n\nSo, thank you.\n\n(U.S. Department of Commerce)"

Ltd. has been issued patent number 12230507, according to news reporting originating out of Alexandria, Virginia, by NewsRx editors. The patent' s inventors are Chang, Po-Chin, Huang, Shih-Chun, Lin, Li-Te, Lin, Pinyen, Lin, Wei-Liang, Liu, Ru-Gun, Shen,... 2025 MAR 06 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Daily Asia Business -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (Hsinchu, Taiwan) has been issued patent number 12230507, according to news reporting originating out of Alexandria, Virginia, by NewsRx editors.\n\nThe patent's inventors are Chang, Po-Chin (Taichung, TW), Huang, Shih-Chun (Hsinchu, TW), Lin, Li-Te (Hsinchu, TW), Lin, Pinyen (Rochester, NY, US), Lin, Wei-Liang (Hsinchu, TW), Liu, Ru-Gun (Zhubei, TW), Shen, Yu-Tien (Tainan, TW), Wu, Wei-Hao (Hsinchu, TW), Yeh, Ya-Wen (Taipei, TW), Yen, Yung-Sung (New Taipei, TW).\n\nThis patent was filed on April 25, 2023 and was published online on February 18, 2025.\n\nFrom the background information supplied by the inventors, news correspondents obtained the following quote: \"At semiconductor technology nodes of 7 nm or smaller, line-and-space (L\/S) patterning requires pitch resolution in optical lithography smaller than about 32 nm. In general, even if extreme ultra violet (EUV) lithography is employed, the resolution limitation by EUV single-exposure technology (SPT) is about 28 nm to about 34 nm. To obtain smaller pitch patterns, a double-patterning technology (DPT) with twice repeating lithography exposure processes will be needed for patterning of a L\/S pitch smaller than about 32 nm. However, the cost of EUV with the DPT approach would be too expensive for a mass-production application.\"\n\nSupplementing the background information on this patent, NewsRx reporters also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: \"It is to be understood that the following disclosure provides many different embodiments, or examples, for implementing different features of the invention. Specific embodiments or examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. For example, dimensions of elements are not limited to the disclosed range or values, but may depend upon process conditions and\/or desired properties of the device. Moreover, the formation of a first feature over or on a second feature in the description that follows may include embodiments in which the first and second features are formed in direct contact, and may also include embodiments in which additional features may be formed interposing the first and second features, such that the first and second features may not be in direct contact. Various features may be arbitrarily drawn in different scales for simplicity and clarity. In the accompanying drawings, some layers\/features may be omitted for simplification.\n\n\"Further, spatially relative terms, such as \"beneath,\" \"below,\" \"lower,\" \"above,\" \"upper\" and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. The spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein may likewise be interpreted accordingly. In addition, the term \"made of\" may mean either \"comprising\" or \"consisting of.\" Further, in the following fabrication process, there may be one or more additional operations inbetween the described operations, and the order of operations may be changed. In the present disclosure, the phrase \"at least one of A, B and C\" means either one of A, B, C, A+B, A+C, B+C or A+B+C, and does not mean one from A, one from B and one from C, unless otherwise explained.\n\n\"Disclosed embodiments relate to a semiconductor device, in particular, a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (CMOS FET), for example, a fin field effect transistor (FinFET) and its manufacturing method.

        "Headline":"TSMC's US $100 billion investment wouldn't save it from all tariffs",
        "Story":"TSMC's US $100 billion investment wouldn't save it from all tariffsMar 06, 2025\n\nTSMC\u2019s $100 billion investment in the US was supposed to help put the company in President Donald Trump\u2019s good graces\u2014or was it? Despite TSMC\u2019s eye-watering investment, there is a chance that the company could still end up paying tariffs on its chips, which is part of Trump\u2019s plan to bolster the US economy by encouraging local manufacturing and production.\n\n\u201c By doing it here, he has no tariffs ,\u201d said Trump to reporters, referring to TSMC and its CEO, C.C. Wei. However, according to a person familiar with the matter, this might simply be a play on words. Yes, TSMC making its semiconductors in the US wouldn\u2019t result in tariffs\u2014that much is obvious. But at the same time, it doesn\u2019t mean the company won\u2019t escape tariffs on its products imported from overseas, like China.\n\nA play on words\n\nThe Trump administration is currently deliberating the idea of imposing chip tariffs on TSMC and other Taiwanese chipmakers. This could result in tariffs as high as 100%. In one version of the plan, officials propose applying these tariffs not just to the chips themselves but also to products using them, such as Apple\u2019s iPhones. If Apple\u2019s iPhones weren\u2019t expensive enough, these tariffs could push their prices through the roof.\n\nIt\u2019s not so easy\n\nHowever, there is a chance that these tariffs, if implemented at all, would be as effective as Trump hopes. This is due to how the semiconductor supply chain works. The semiconductor industry relies on components made by companies all over the world. If Trump imposes 100% tariffs on imports from Taiwan, companies will find a workaround to bypass the restrictions. For example, they could assemble its chips in a different part of the world. That is, unless Trump decides to impose tariffs on all countries.\n\nThese tariffs might also not be as devastating as one would think. According to Chris Miller, a history professor at Tufts University, \u201cTSMC might make a bit less money, the fabless company that designs the chips might make a bit less money, and the end company that actually sells the products that the chip is assembled into might also find their product margin squeezed.\u201d\n\nTaiwan-based semiconductor industry insider, known by the alias Hsu Mei-hu, also expressed their doubts about these tariffs. \u201cThe industry around the world has never dealt with chip tariffs like this before. It\u2019s theoretically possible, but nearly impossible in practice.\u201d\n\nThe post TSMC's US $100 billion investment wouldn't save it from all tariffs appeared first on Android Headlines.\n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Ltd. (Hsinchu, Taiwan) has been issued patent number 12232307, according to news reporting originating out of Alexandria, Virginia, by NewsRx editors.\n\nThe patent's inventors are Jeng, Shin-Puu (Hsinchu, TW), Lin, Po-Yao (Zhudong Township, TW), Wang, Chin-Hua (New Taipei, TW), Yeh, Shu-Shen (Hsinchu, TW), Yew, Ming-Chih (Hsinchu, TW).\n\nThis patent was filed on August 7, 2023 and was published online on February 18, 2025.\n\nFrom the background information supplied by the inventors, news correspondents obtained the following quote: \"Interfaces between a fan-out wafer level package (FOWLP) and a molding compound material portion are subjected to mechanical stress during subsequent handling of an assembly of the FOWLP, the underfill material portion, and a packaging substrate, such as attachment of the packaging substrate to a printed circuit board (PCB). In addition, interfaces between a FOWLP and an underfill material portion are subjected to mechanical stress during use within a computing device, such as when the FOWLP heats up during usage and mismatch in thermal expansion of components of the FOWLP induces thermal stress or when a mobile device is accidently dropped to cause a mechanical shock during usage. Cracks may be formed in the underfill material, and may induce additional cracks in a semiconductor die, solder material portions, redistribution structures, and\/or various dielectric layers within a semiconductor die or within a package substrate. Thus, formation of cracks in the underfill material needs to be suppressed.\"\n\nSupplementing the background information on this patent, NewsRx reporters also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: \"The following disclosure provides many different embodiments, or examples, for implementing different features of the provided subject matter. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. For example, the formation of a first feature over or on a second feature in the description that follows may include embodiments in which the first and second features are formed in direct contact, and may also include embodiments in which additional features may be formed between the first and second features, such that the first and second features may not be in direct contact. In addition, the present disclosure may repeat reference numerals and\/or letters in the various examples. This repetition is for the purpose of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and\/or configurations discussed.\n\n\"Further, spatially relative terms, such as \"beneath,\" \"below,\" \"lower,\" \"above,\" \"upper\" and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. The spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. The apparatus may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein may likewise be interpreted accordingly. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, each element having the same reference numeral is presumed to have the same material composition and to have a thickness within a same thickness range.\n\n\"The present disclosure is directed to semiconductor devices, and particularly to uniform application of an underfill material in semiconductor die packaging. Generally, the methods and structures of the present disclosure may be used to provide a chip package structure such as a fan-out wafer level package (FOWLP) or a fan-out panel level package (FOPLP). While the present disclosure is described using an FOWLP configuration, the methods and structures of the present disclosure may be implemented in an FOPLP configuration or any other fan-out or fan-in package configuration.\n\n\"Metal bonding structures on semiconductor dies and redistribution structures may increase the capillary force during application of an underfill material. The increased capillary force may be advantageously used to enhance uniformity of the underfill material distribution around the metal bonding structures in a die-to-die gap or in a die-to-package gap (such as a die-to-chip-scale-package gap). According to an aspect of the present disclosure, the flow uniformity of an underfill material may be enhanced using dummy metal bonding structures and\/or dummy solder material portions. Void formation within an underfill material portion within a die-to-die gap or a die-to-package gap may be avoided or reduced through use of the dummy structures of the present disclosure that enhance the capillary force in inter-die regions.\n\n\"For example, a high performance computing (HPC) package may comprise multiple semiconductor dies including at least one system-on-chip (SoC) die and at least one high bandwidth memory (HBM) die within a chiplet, such as a fan-out wafer level package. Die-to-die gaps and\/or die-to-chip-scale-package gaps increase the complexity of an underfill material dispensation step. In instances in which the underfill material flows non-uniformly, voids may be formed within the underfill material portion in gap regions. Such voids in the underfill material may cause solder bridging or a \"popcorn\" phenomenon in which solder material portions are securely attached to metal bonding structures. The dummy structures of embodiments of the present disclosure may be used to avoid or reduce formation voids in the underfill material. The various aspects and embodiments of the methods and structures of the present disclosure are described with reference to accompanying drawings.\"\n\nThe claims supplied by the inventors are:\n\n\"1.

Ltd. (Hsin-Chu, Taiwan) has been issued patent number 12227865, according to news reporting originating out of Alexandria, Virginia, by NewsRx editors.\n\nThe patent's inventors are Chang, Chao Yuan (Tainan, TW), Chen, Chao-Lung (Tainan, TW), Hou, Wen-Chun (Tainan, TW), Hsiao, Chin-Hsin (Tainan, TW), Jiang, Ping-Ching (Tainan, TW), Kung, Chun-An (Yuanlin, TW), Lin, Che-Min (Kaohsiung, TW), Lu, Hung-San (Tainan, TW), Yang, Szu-Hung (Tainan, TW).\n\nThis patent was filed on July 25, 2022 and was published online on February 18, 2025.\n\nFrom the background information supplied by the inventors, news correspondents obtained the following quote: \"Semiconductor devices are used in a variety of electronic applications. The manufacture of semiconductor devices includes various processes, including electroplating semiconductor wafers.\"\n\nSupplementing the background information on this patent, NewsRx reporters also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: \"The following disclosure provides several different embodiments, or examples, for implementing different features of the provided subject matter. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. For example, the formation of a first feature over or on a second feature in the description that follows may include embodiments in which the first and second features are formed in direct contact and may also include embodiments in which additional features may be formed between the first and second features, such that the first and second features may not be in direct contact. In addition, the present disclosure may repeat reference numerals or letters in the various examples. This repetition is for the purpose of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments or configurations discussed.\n\n\"Further, spatially relative terms, such as \"beneath,\" \"below,\" \"lower,\" \"above,\" \"upper\" and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. The spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation illustrated in the figures. The apparatus may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein may likewise be interpreted accordingly.\n\n\"A plating apparatus for electroplating a surface of a wafer with a metal film is disclosed. The plating apparatus directs a flow of ions of a metal to the wafer where the ions interact with the wafer to form the metal film, also referred to as a plating film, on the surface of the wafer. An ion shield is disposed in the plating apparatus between a source of the ions (e.g., such as a block or slab of the metal) and the wafer. The flow of ions to different portions of the wafer is guided by the configuration of the ion shield.\n\n\"Components of the plating apparatus include a membrane support configured to mitigate sagging of an exchange membrane. In some embodiments, the membrane support is configured as the ion shield. Thus, the membrane support is configured to both inhibit the exchange membrane from sagging and to guide the flow of ions to different portions of the wafer. The membrane support includes ion blocking regions and ion flow-through regions (e.g., apertures formed through the membrane support). The flow of ions through the membrane support is greater through portions of the membrane support that have a greater area of ion flow-through regions than an area of ion blocking regions. Ions of the metal that are blocked by the ion blocking regions are redirected to flow through the ion flow-through regions. Some portions of the membrane support have a greater number or size of ion blocking regions than other portions of the membrane support. Thus, the flow of ions through portions of the membrane support that have a greater number or size of ion blocking regions is less than the flow of ions through portions of the membrane support that have a greater number or size of ion flow-through regions.\n\n\"The plating apparatus includes a voltage source directly coupled to the source of the ions and to an outer portion or edge portion of the wafer. Ions of the metal flow from the source of the ions towards the wafer. When a voltage is applied to the wafer, ions of the metal interact with the wafer to form the metal film on the surface of the wafer. When the voltage is applied to the edge portion of the wafer, the strength of an electromagnetic field is stronger at the edge portion of the wafer than at the center portion of the wafer. Consequently, a greater concentration of ions of the metal are pulled towards the edge portion of the wafer than to the center portion of the wafer. However, the membrane support directs a greater flow of ions to the center portion of the wafer. The greater flow of ions to the center portion of the wafer compensates for the stronger electromagnetic field at the edge portions of the wafer to promote the formation of a metal film having a uniform thickness across the surface of the wafer.\"\n\nThe claims supplied by the inventors are:\n\n\"1. A method for plating a wafer, comprising: directing a carrier solution to an anode in a plating chamber to produce plating ions; directing a first flow of the plating ions towards a center portion of the wafer; and directing a second flow of the plating ions towards edge portions of the wafer, wherein a rate of the first flow is greater than a rate of the second flow, wherein: directing the first flow of the plating ions and the second flow of the plating ions comprises: controlling a rate at which the plating ions flow from the anode toward the wafer using a structure comprising a membrane support comprising ion blocking regions that define a plurality of apertures, apertures of the plurality of apertures in a first zone of the membrane support have a first diameter, apertures of the plurality of apertures in a second zone of the membrane support have a second diameter, apertures of the plurality of apertures in a third zone of the membrane support have a third diameter, the third diameter is larger than the first diameter and larger than the second diameter, and the third zone is between the first zone and the second zone.\n\n\"2.

Ltd. (Hsinchu, Taiwan).\n\nThe following quote was obtained by the news editors from the background information supplied by the inventors: \"Integrated chips are fabricated in semiconductor fabrication facilities. Fabrication facilities contain processing tools that are configured to perform processing steps (e.g., etching steps, photolithography steps, deposition steps, etc.) upon a semiconductor substrate (e.g., a silicon wafer). Photolithography is a commonly used processing step by which a pattern of a photomask is transferred to the semiconductor substrate.\"\n\nIn addition to the background information obtained for this patent, NewsRx journalists also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: \"The present disclosure provides many different embodiments, or examples, for implementing different features of this disclosure. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. For example, the formation of a first feature over or on a second feature in the description that follows may include embodiments in which the first and second features are formed in direct contact, and may also include embodiments in which additional features may be formed between the first and second features, such that the first and second features may not be in direct contact. In addition, the present disclosure may repeat reference numerals and\/or letters in the various examples. This repetition is for the purpose of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and\/or configurations discussed.\n\n\"Further, spatially relative terms, such as \"beneath,\" \"below,\" \"lower,\" \"above,\" \"upper\" and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. The spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. The apparatus may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein may likewise be interpreted accordingly.\n\n\"Moreover, \"first\", \"second\", \"third\", etc. may be used herein for ease of description to distinguish between different elements of a figure or a series of figures. \"first\", \"second\", \"third\", etc. are not intended to be descriptive of the corresponding element, but rather are merely generic identifiers. For example, \"a first dielectric layer\" described in connection with a first figure may not necessarily correspond to a \"first dielectric layer\" described in connection with some embodiments, but rather may correspond to a \"second dielectric layer\" in other embodiments.\n\n\"A three-dimensional (3D) integrated circuit (IC) comprises a plurality of IC die that are stacked over one another. One possible method to manufacture a 3D IC includes a wafer stacking method that includes bonding a first 2D IC structure to a handle wafer and subsequently forming a second 2D IC structure over the first 2D IC structure. Forming the second 2D IC structure over the first 2D IC structure includes performing multiple processing steps in a fabrication facility. The processing step place patterned layers over the first 2D IC structure, and at least some of the patterned layers may be formed using a photolithography tool. In order for the 3D IC to operate correctly, the patterned layers of the second 2D IC structure should be aligned accurately with one another and with patterned layers of the first 2D IC structure. Misalignment between the patterned layers of the first and second 2D IC structures may cause short circuits or connection failures, which significantly impact device yield. When forming a patterned layer of the second 2D IC structure, the photolithography tool may be aligned according to a circumferential edge and\/or a notch of the handle wafer to mitigate misalignment between patterned layers of the first and second 2D IC structures. With the increase in complexity and\/or shrinkage of device features of ICs, accurate alignment becomes more important to prevent short circuits and\/or connection failures between patterned layers of the first and\/or second 2D IC structures. The first 2D IC structure may include a first interconnect structure disposed on a semiconductor wafer. A plurality of semiconductor devices may be disposed on\/within the semiconductor wafer. Further, the semiconductor wafer and the handle wafer may each comprise a notch disposed along a circumferential edge and\/or may each comprise one or more bonding alignment marks.\n\n\"One challenge with the above 3D IC manufacturing method is misalignment between the first 2D IC structure and the handle wafer after the bonding process. For example, during the bonding process, a light sensor (e.g., an infrared (IR) sensor) is utilized to ensure the semiconductor wafer is aligned (e.g., optically-aligned) with the handle wafer by virtue of wafer features (e.g., the notch, the circumferential edge, and\/or the bonding marks of the semiconductor and\/or handle wafers). However, due to processing tool limitations, a misalignment distance between a center of the semiconductor wafer and a center of the handle wafer after the bonding process may be relatively large (e.g., greater than about 70 nanometers (nm)). The relatively large misalignment distance may result in inaccurate alignment during fabrication of patterned layers of the second 2D IC structure over the bonded semiconductor wafer and the handle wafer. This, in part, may result in short circuits and\/or connection failures between the patterned layers of the second 2D IC structure and the semiconductor devices of the first 2D IC structure, thereby decreasing device yield. Failures as a result of the misalignment may be exacerbated as feature sizes of the first and second 2D IC structures shrink.\"\n\nThe claims supplied by the inventors are:\n\n\"1. A method for forming an integrated chip, comprising: performing an alignment process on a first semiconductor workpiece and a second semiconductor workpiece by virtue of a plurality of workpiece pins; bonding the first semiconductor workpiece to the second semiconductor workpiece; determining a shift value between the first and second semiconductor workpieces by virtue of a first plurality of alignment marks on the first semiconductor workpiece and a second plurality of alignment marks on the second semiconductor workpiece; and forming a layer of an integrated circuit (IC) structure over the second semiconductor workpiece based at least in part on the shift value.\n\n\"2.

        "Headline":"TSMC And Intel Investments At Risk As Trump Targets $52B CHIPS Act",
        "Story":"TSMC And Intel Investments At Risk As Trump Targets $52B CHIPS ActMar 06, 2025\n\nImage courtesy of 123rf.com\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has reignited debate over the future of the United States\u2019 semiconductor industry by calling for the end of the\u00a0$52 billion Chips Act subsidy program. This initiative, established during the Biden administration, has already attracted over $400 billion in investments from major corporations like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE: TSM) and Intel Corp (NYSE: INTC).\n\nTrump criticized the program as a misuse of taxpayer money and instead proposed tariffs as a means to promote domestic chip production. He argued that tariffs could achieve similar objectives while simultaneously generating government revenue. Despite his criticism, the Chips Act is widely regarded as essential for national and economic security, with numerous projects already underway in various states.\n\nTrump Administration to Review CHIPS Act\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s decision to review existing contracts under the Chips Act has raised concerns among companies benefiting from the program. TSMC, in particular, has expressed apprehension over potential modifications to their agreements.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has indicated that newly announced projects may not receive federal funds, further fueling uncertainty. This move has prompted industry leaders to question the future stability of their investments and the potential impact on the semiconductor supply chain. The review process is expected to be thorough, with implications for both domestic and international stakeholders.\n\nINTC and TSM Stock Brief\n\nIntel Corp. has experienced notable fluctuations in its stock price amid the ongoing discussions surrounding the Chips Act. As of March 5, 2025, the stock opened at $21.35 but saw a decline to $20.81. The day\u2019s low reached $20.18, with a high of $21.36. In\u00a0premarket trading, the stock has witnessed a decline of over 1% as of the time of writing.\n\nOver the past year, the stock has seen a low of $18.51 and a high of $46.63. The company\u2019s current market capitalization stands at $90.11 billion, with a\u00a0dividend yield\u00a0of 2.24%. Despite the recent dip, analysts maintain a \u201chold\u201d recommendation, with a target mean price of $22.77.\n\nIn contrast, TSMC has shown resilience in the face of potential policy changes. The company\u2019s stock opened at $183.00 and rose to $184.28 on March 6, 2025. The day\u2019s high reached $184.74, with a low of $180.72. As of current premarket trading, the stock is down over 2.30%. TSMC\u2019s market capitalization is a robust $955.78 billion, and it boasts a dividend yield of 1.49%.

        "Story":"Taiwan chipmaker to invest $100 billion in U.S.; multibillion dollar investment not due to pressure from Trump, say investorsTaipei-The president of Taiwan and chipmaker TSMC held a joint press conference on Thursday to defend the company's decision to invest $100 billion (mdd) in the United States, saying the decision was driven by customer demand rather than pressure from President Donald Trump's administration.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world's largest chipmaker, announced earlier this week that it would invest $100 billion in three new chip manufacturing plants, along with two packaging facilities in Arizona.\n\nThe decision raised concerns that Taiwan would get little in return for moving some of its most advanced manufacturing processes to the United States.\n\nTaiwan's president, Lai Ching-te, denied that TSMC's investment decision was due to political pressure from the United States. Trump earlier said Taiwan took the chip business away from the U.S. and wanted it back.\n\n\"TSMC's decision is necessary for its future development. The government faced no pressure from the U.S. during TSMC's investment process in the U.S.,\" Lai said Thursday.\n\nHigh demand prompted multibillion-dollar investment in U.S., TSMC says\n\nTSMC CEO C.C. Wei commented that he had talked to the company's customers and realized that TSMC's current U.S. expansion plans were insufficient to meet current demand.\n\n\"Customer demand has been steadily increasing. For TSMC, our investment plans are based on customer needs, and we are very cautious,\" Wei said.\n\n\"The amount of investment in the U.S. may seem large, but it is not enough to meet demand,\" he added.\n\nHe also mentioned that development plans in the U.S. would not affect TSMC's plans in Taiwan, and that the company currently has 10,000 employees researching and developing 1.0-nanometer chips.\n\nTaiwan, the \"bone of contention\" between the US and China\n\nAlthough Taiwan is a self-governing island, Beijing considers it to be a rebel province that must be taken back by force if necessary.\n\nThe United States does not recognize Taiwan as a country, but is its biggest supporter and arms supplier.\n\nHowever, continued U.S. support appears increasingly fragile in the Trump administration, which has argued that Taiwan is too dependent on the United States and needs to spend more on defense.\n\nA Pentagon nominee said earlier this week that Taiwan should spend about 10% of its gross domestic product on defense to deter China from starting a war.\n\nLast month, Lai pledged to increase defense spending to more than 3% of its gross domestic product, up from less than 2.5%."

        "Story":"President Trump, TSMC Announce $100 Billion Investment in ArizonaPhoenix: Arizona Commerce Authority has issued the following news release:\n\nFollowing a meeting at the White House today, President Trump and TSMC Chairman and CEO C.C. Wei announced a historic expansion of TSMC\u2019s advanced semiconductor operations in Arizona. TSMC will invest at least an additional $100 billion to build three additional semiconductor fabs in Arizona as well as two advanced packaging facilities and a major R&D Center. The investment comes in addition to TSMC\u2019s three fabs already in operation or under construction in Arizona and will represent thousands of additional new jobs.\n\nTSMC announced its first fab in Arizona in May 2020. Since then, its presence has grown to three cutting-edge chip-making fabs and supporting facilities, representing a $65 billion investment and 6,000 jobs. Today\u2019s announcement brings TSMC\u2019s total announced investment in Arizona to $165 billion.\n\nIn January, TSMC announced it had begun producing advanced 4-nanometer chips for U.S. customers in Arizona, a first on American soil and a major milestone in the country\u2019s efforts to reshore manufacturing of the most advanced microchips. Its second fab, which is under construction, is expected to produce the world\u2019s most advanced 2nm process technology with next generation nanosheet transistors in addition to the previously announced 3nm technology. TSMC\u2019s third fab will produce chips using 2nm or more advanced processes, with production beginning by the end of the decade.\n\n\u201cTSMC\u2019s historic announcement cements Arizona as the epicenter of advanced chip manufacturing and innovation in America,\u201d said Governor Katie Hobbs. \u201cWith the country\u2019s most advanced chip-making processes, world class university partners, and a robust and growing talent pipeline, Arizona is powering the groundbreaking technologies of the future like AI. I\u2019m grateful to President Trump, TSMC, and all our partners for making this historic day possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is huge news for Arizona that officially cements our state as a global hub for building the most advanced microchips in the world and will put tens of thousands of Arizonans to work in good-paying jobs that do not require a 4-year degree,\u201d said Arizona Senator and lead negotiator of the CHIPS and Science Act Mark Kelly. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement builds on years of bipartisan collaboration between Arizona\u2019s federal, state, and local leaders and our economic development teams to make our state the best place in the country to build these one-of-a-kind facilities. By boosting domestic microchip development and production, we\u2019re reducing reliance on foreign supply chains and making sure America leads the way in the industries of the future.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\"Earlier this month, my team met with representatives of TSMC to discuss their plans for future jobs in Arizona, which should focus on tapping into our veteran workforce,\" stated U.S. Representative Abe Hamadeh, whose Congressional District serves as home to TSMC. \"They are clearly committed to President Trump's American First Manufacturing agenda, bringing high-paying employment opportunities to CD8 allowing US leaders to increase the quality of life for our residents.\n\n\u201cTSMC is doubling down on its investment with an expansion in Phoenix testament to the U.S. semiconductor industry growth that will deliver a major win for American workers,\u201d said Mayor Kate Gallego. \u201cThis investment further strengthens domestic chip manufacturing, reduces reliance on foreign supply chains, and enhances national security. Billions in investment and thousands of high-tech, high-paying jobs illustrate how TSMC is a partner in cementing Phoenix as a global leader in semiconductor production. This expansion energizes innovation that fosters more economic growth, opportunities for skilled workers, and positions the Phoenix region at the forefront of advanced manufacturing.\u201d\n\n\u201cArizona is unrivaled in the advancement and scale of new chip investment taking place - with expansions across leading-edge manufacturing, advanced packaging, research and development, equipment, suppliers, workforce development and more,\u201d said Sandra Watson, President and CEO of the Arizona Commerce Authority. \u201cWe are immensely grateful to TSMC for their historic investment and steadfast commitment to Arizona and we thank President Trump, Governor Hobbs, Senator Kelly, and all our federal, state, university, and local partners for their continued collaboration.\u201d\n\n\u201cSmart policy leads to big investment, and today\u2019s announcement is the latest proof that Arizona is getting it right. Our pro-business approach has made us a national leader in advanced manufacturing, and TSMC\u2019s expansion reinforces our position at the forefront of the semiconductor industry,\u201d said Danny Seiden, president and CEO of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce & Industry. \u201cWe appreciate President Trump\u2019s focus on bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. and reshoring critical industries like semiconductors. These investments ensure that the most advanced chips in the world are made right here in the United States, strengthening our economy and national security.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreater Phoenix has built a competitive semiconductor ecosystem amplified by TSMC\u2019s initial investment, boasting world-class companies in research and development, packaging, chemicals, and other components of the supply chain,\u201d said Chris Camacho, President and CEO of the Greater Phoenix Economic Council. \u201cThis additional commitment from TSMC reflects the strength of our region to catapult vital technologies and will further position Greater Phoenix as an internationally recognized leader of next-generation innovation.\u201d\n\n\"Natcast congratulates the state of Arizona and NSTC member, TSMC, on its proposed $100 billion investment in U.S. chips manufacturing, packaging, and R&D,\" said Deirdre Hanford, CEO, Natcast. \"Arizona was selected as the anticipated location for the CHIPS for America NSTC Prototyping and NAPMP Advanced Packaging Piloting Facility (PFF) based on its robust and growing ecosystem. Together we will drive U.S.-led innovation, expand a skilled workforce, and strengthen our economic and national security.\u201d\n\nIn January, the U.S. Commerce Department and Natcast, the operator of the National Semiconductor Technology Center (NSTC), announced Arizona as the site of the co-located NSTC Prototyping and NAPMP Advanced Packaging Piloting Facility, the third of three CHIPS for America research and development (R&D) flagship facilities. The facility will combine 300mm research and prototyping for front-end manufacturing and packaging capabilities, meeting a unique need for advanced packaging R&D within the U.S. semiconductor ecosystem."

Wei, hanno tenuto una conferenza stampa gioved\u00ec alle 17:00 ora locale a Taipei, come riferisce Bloomberg.\n\nWei ha dichiarato di \"non temere\" di perdere le sovvenzioni di Washington per i suoi massicci investimenti negli Stati Uniti, come riferisce il Financial Times dalla conferenza stampa congiunta. Il titolo \u00e8 in ribasso oggi.\n\nAll'inizio della settimana, il produttore di chip taiwanese ha annunciato l'intenzione di investire altri 100 miliardi di dollari nelle sue strutture statunitensi, oltre agli attuali 65 miliardi di dollari.\n\nIl presidente Donald Trump ha criticato Taiwan durante la sua campagna elettorale per il presunto furto della posizione dei semiconduttori statunitensi e per i massicci deficit commerciali con il Paese. Trump ha minacciato dazi di ritorsione contro il Paese insulare, che si affida agli Stati Uniti per il sostegno militare contro un'invasione cinese.\n\nQualsiasi ulteriore investimento statunitense effettuato da TSMC richiederebbe l'approvazione del governo di Taiwan. Taiwan ha sostenuto che il Paese continuer\u00e0 ad essere la sede principale dei semiconduttori avanzati, in risposta ai report che indicavano la migrazione della sua tecnologia avanzata verso gli Stati Uniti, attualmente in costrizione.\n\nTrump ha anche suggerito di eliminare le sovvenzioni statunitensi ai produttori di chip per la costruzione di fabbriche nel Paese, al fine di rafforzare la sua posizione nel settore dei semiconduttori.\n\nIn un aggiornamento separato, Cristiano Amon, capo di Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM), ha applaudito l'investimento di Taiwan Semiconductor negli Stati Uniti e ha detto alla CNBC che aiuter\u00e0 a diversificare le sedi dei produttori di chip. Ha sottolineato che le tendenze tecnologiche a lungo termine supereranno qualsiasi incertezza a breve termine relativa ai dazi di Trump.\n\nAmon ha dichiarato alla CNBC che alcuni dei chip di Qualcomm sono gi\u00e0 prodotti negli impianti di Taiwan Semiconductor in Arizona e che l'azienda produrr\u00e0 altri semiconduttori negli Stati Uniti.\n\nLo stesso Amon ha sottolineato che gli aggiornamenti per gli smartphone IA, i PC IA e le auto che diventano computer sono tendenze tecnologiche chiave che probabilmente sosterranno l'attivit\u00e0 di Qualcomm nel lungo termine rispetto all'incertezza tariffaria a breve termine.\n\nIDC prevede che il produttore di chip taiwanese avr\u00e0 una quota del 67% del mercato globale delle fonderie nel 2025.\n\nPrezzo delle azioni TSM\n\nIl titolo TSM \u00e8 in calo del 2,87% a 178,99 dollari nel momento in cui scriviamo.\n\nPer ulteriori aggiornamenti su questo argomento, aggiungi Benzinga Italia ai tuoi preferiti oppure seguici sui nostri canali social: X e Facebook.\n\nRicevi informazioni esclusive sui movimenti di mercato 30 minuti prima degli altri trader\n\nLa prova gratuita di 14 giorni di Benzinga Pro, disponibile solo in inglese, ti permette di accedere ad informazioni esclusive per poter ricevere segnali di trading utilizzabili prima di milioni di altri trader.

The firm has been facing calls to move more production abroad.Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te on Thursday hailed the semiconductor giant TSMC's plan to invest $100 billion (\u20ac92.7 billion) in the United States as a \"historic moment\" for Taiwan-US ties.\n\nLai said that the government was not pressured by Washington, the self-ruled island's most important security benefactor, \"during TSMC's US investment process.\"\n\nThe world's largest chipmaker announced the plan earlier this week after US President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on imported semiconductor chips.\n\nThe announcement brings TSMC's investment in the US to $165 billion, which the chip manufacturing powerhouse said was the \"largest single foreign direct investment in US history.\"\n\nWhat prompted TSMC investment in the US?\n\nThe expansion is \"driven by customer demand,\" said TSMC chairman and chief executive C.C. Wei at a joint news conference with Lai on Thursday.\n\n\"We went to Japan because of Japanese customer demand, to Germany because of German customer demand, and four years ago to the US because of American customer demand,\" he said.\n\n\"Now, we are increasing our investment because the demand from US customers is extremely high,\" Wei added.\n\nIn Taiwan, TSMC, whose major clients include Nvidia and Apple, plans to build 11 new production lines this year to meet demand, according to Wei.\n\nTaiwan's semiconductor dominance\n\nThe move stoked fears that Trump was trying to take control of TSMC's production.\n\nThe world's largest chipmaker has long faced demands to move factories out of Taiwan, where TSMC has its headquarters and the bulk of its chip plants, as tensions with Beijing intensify.\n\nChina has upped military pressure on the self-ruled island Beijing claims as its own in recent years.\n\nThe semiconductor industry in Taiwan has long been seen as a \"silicon shield\" that deters Chinese aggression.

        "Story":"Micron appoints former Taiwan TSMC chair to company boardMemory maker Micron appointed former TSMC Chair Mark Liu as part of its board of directors, the company announced Wednesday.\n\nIn a press release, Micron President and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said Liu is a leader with strong technical expertise, per CNA. 'He has decades of experience leading one of the world's most advanced and sophisticated semiconductor companies, with fab operations at the largest scale,\" it said.\n\nMehrotra said Liu's decades of experience will help Micron scale its business and seize AI-driven opportunities across data centers and edge computing.\n\nIndustry experts said while TSMC's CoWoS high-bandwidth memory (HBM) collaboration with South Korea's Hynix remains strong, Micron has recently made inroads into TSMC's supply chain, per Liberty Times. Liu's appointment may help strengthen ties between the two companies.\n\nHowever, other market sources argue that since HBM is procured by customers and merely stacked in TSMC's CoWoS process, Nvidia's primary supplier remains Hynix. Close collaboration between TSMC and Hynix is essential to ensure optimal performance for AI chipsets combining GPUs and HBM.\n\nFurthermore, board positions are often more symbolic than functional, and whether Liu's role at Micron will impact its relationship with TSMC remains to be seen, they said.\n\nLiu joined TSMC in 1993 as engineering deputy director, where he established the company's first 8-inch wafer fab and later led the development of its first 12-inch fab. After TSMC founder Morris Chang retired in June 2018, Liu took over as chair, a position he held until his retirement in June last year."

Aired 3-4a ET\n\n[03:00:00]\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN ANCHOR: Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us from all around the world and to everyone streaming us on CNN Max. I'm Rosemary Church. Just ahead.\n\nEurope prepares for the possibility of going it alone, with leaders gathering in Brussels to hammer out a plan to better defend Ukraine and themselves.\n\nAfter pressure from car makers and the markets, the U.S. President delays auto tariffs on Canada and Mexico for one month.\n\nAnd Pope Francis spends another peaceful night in the hospital. We are live in Rome with the latest on the pontiff's health.\n\nUNKNOWN (voice-over): Live from Atlanta, this is \"CNN Newsroom\" with Rosemary Church.\n\nCHURCH: Good to have you with us.\n\nWell, strengthening defenses across Europe and support for Ukraine will top the agenda at a summit in Brussels set to get underway soon. European leaders are meeting at a crucial time as the new Trump administration in the U.S. has paused critical support for Ukraine and made it abundantly clear that Europe needs to invest more in its own defense.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron is even warning that Europe may need to be prepared to go it alone.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nEMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT (through translator): I would like to believe that the United States will stay by our side, but we have to be ready if this isn't the case.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCHURCH: Adding to the urgency of the summit, more deadly attacks inside Ukraine. Officials say a Russian airstrike targeted President Zelenskyy's hometown, killing at least four people and injuring more than 30 others.\n\nWe're now learning the U.S. didn't just pause military aid to Ukraine, but also crucial intelligence sharing. It's a move that could have dire consequences for Ukrainian troops on the battlefield.\n\nCNN's Nick Paton-Walsh has the details from Kyiv.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nNICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Again, whiplash here in Kyiv. It had seemed that pause in military aid that Kyiv be moving to potentially fix the rift with the White House. Zelenskyy found the Oval Office blow-up to have been regrettable and a letter that President Trump talked about Zelenskyy having written to him during his speech suggesting that Zelenskyy was willing to sign the rare earths mineral deal at the White House's convenience and wanted to commit to peace.\n\nBut still, the following day, Kyiv waking up again with more bad news that senior Trump security officials saying that aid intelligence sharing had been paused.\n\nNow that, according to CIA's Director John Ratcliffe, was something that he thought, he said, might end up being reversed at some point, resumed. But the National Security Advisor Mike Waltz suggested that there needed to be further signs from Ukraine that it was willing to come to the negotiating table to sign on to a process.\n\nThe big problem, I think, for Ukrainians and their European allies is it's not really clear what process the White House is hoping Ukraine will sign up to.\n\nIs it the one that the U.S. is negotiating with Russia without Ukraine or European allies? Is it the one the Europeans are putting together themselves, which has Ukrainian backing and may end up seeing a reassurance force boots on the ground to some degree inside of Ukraine if indeed there is a ceasefire or is it something else more general, a feeling that President Trump wants to have that Zelenskyy is more willing to negotiate?\n\nWe simply don't know, but the Europeans appear to be moving forwards relatively quickly. A public address from French President Emmanuel Macron ahead of key meeting in Brussels of European leaders. Their second in just five or six days, which Zelenskyy will indeed attend.\n\nMacron suggesting that Europe needs to do better to defend itself, saying that Russian aggression is unchecked at its own borders, reminding French people that Russia is spending 40 percent of its GDP on defense at the moment. Also saying that France might need to expand its nuclear umbrella to protect neighbors like Germany.\n\nA lot moving in the European sphere. A European official telling me that the British, French and Turkish may up contributing the significant part of this reassurance force if it is needed inside of Ukraine. This European official saying without the possibility of American psychological or practical logistical assistance, it would be very high risk, if not impossible, to pull this off.\n\nBut real questions as to whether Trump administration fits in all of this. Macron making it clear he feels Europe may have to go this alone, although they do urgently, except they need the U.S. on side during this.\n\n[03:05:00]\n\nAll of this fascination and at times it seems collapse in the transatlantic and western alliances, leaving Ukrainians deeply worried about what support they can rely upon. And indeed, for the moment when Russia may take advantage.\n\nJust in the last hours, we've heard of a ballistic missile strike hitting one city in Ukraine, Kryvyi Rih, the hometown of Zelenskyy, in which two people have been killed and many more injured. Horrific scenes, possibly because of the lack of air defense missiles that form part of U.S. aid.\n\nNick Paton Walsh, CNN, Kyiv, Ukraine.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nCHURCH: Tymofiy Mylovanov is the President of the Kyiv School of Economics, he's also a former Ukrainian Minister of Economy. Appreciate you being with us.\n\nTYMOFIY MYLOVANOV, PRESIDENT, KYIV SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS, AND FORMER UKRAINIAN ECONOMY MINISTER: Thank you.\n\nCHURCH: So in the wake of that fierce Oval Office exchange between President Trump and Ukraine's President Zelenskyy last Friday, Europe has taken the reins in an effort to find peace in the war torn nation and to supply military support since Trump recently halted U.S. military aid. What do you expect will come out of this European symposium and what all does Ukraine need right now?\n\nMYLOVANOV: Well, there is the maximum that can come out or something one would like to hope. And I would say I would put it in three categories.\n\nOne is very strong unity and agreement among the European nations and to dedicate substantive financial support to defense procurement development investment, both in Ukraine and in the E.U. The second one would be stricter sanctions, actually, on Russia. And the third one would be seizure of Russian assets, which also could be directed or redistributed towards investments into defense or security guarantees or something of that sort.\n\nI think this is a little bit unrealistic, but that would be the best outcome in my view. What's more realistic is that there would be commitment towards investments and some discussion about security guarantees. CHURCH: So I do want to get back now to the U.S. treatment of President Zelenskyy: a clash with Trump, a pause in U.S. military aid, and now also a pause in intelligence, then a letter from Zelenskyy with a message of regret for that exchange and a commitment to long- lasting peace. It appears that talks are back on track, although the intelligence pause is difficult to understand. But what will peace look like for Ukraine after this back-and-forth with the United States?\n\nMYLOVANOV: Well, yes, indeed, this is a very difficult situation, but the policy of the United States appears to be shaped by these exchanges. It's very clear or sort of very clear what the U.S. will try to achieve.\n\nFirst objective is to get parties to the table. Now there has been a lot of pressure on Zelenskyy recently to sort of agree to come to the table to accept maybe truce or semi-truce or partial truce without any conditions in security guarantees.\n\nSo that appears to be the case now that has been resolved. Once again, the previous position of Zelenskyy was that we need security guarantees first before we come to any table. Ukraine wants to be at the table, but security is first.\n\nNow that's not the case anymore.\n\nBut then we need to get Russia to the table. And then there has to be some kind of compromise on both sides. The U.S. administration has not pressured so far Russia at all, making the argument that it is challenging to get them to the table at all.\n\nSo you have to be nice to them because there is not much leverage over them. You don't have to be nice to Zelenskyy because you have leverage over him, as we have seen with intelligence sharing, denial and military support. So this all is very painful and hurtful to see, but that's the policy.\n\nAnd then the question of what the compromise will be. Russian demands are pretty well known if you are willing to look at them with the open eyes. This is recognition of the occupied territories and maybe more a reduction of the size of the Ukrainian military and limited if possibly no support at all from the West to Ukraine.\n\nNow, these are maximalist demands which are not going to be met. Ukrainian demands are, you know, OK, get the territory maybe de facto, but not legally recognized.\n\nAnd then security guarantees from the West where the parties will meet. It's unclear if there is a possibility for formal settlement is unclear as well.\n\nCHURCH: So what concessions do you think Russia will be forced to make and do you think that Trump can deliver a fair peace deal for Ukraine in the end?\n\nMYLOVANOV: Fair, I'm not so sure. And on top of that, I think fair means different things to different parties.\n\n[03:10:03]\n\nMy understanding is that the Trump administration wants to get peace and a little bit less concerned about whether it's fair, although it has emphasis on lasting. Where I stand, lasting is very important. And unfairness is a great notion.\n\nBut it takes time sometimes. It is very unfair that so many people have died. It's very unfair that a stronger country can invade a smaller country.\n\nBut can Trump or the Trump administration deliver any peace? Even that is a big question mark. I hope they will be able to do that.\n\nWhat the breaking point might be for everyone, both for Russia or for Ukraine, is the security guarantees, is the E.U. troops, is the U.S. security umbrella, the science of the army, everything which Ukraine needs to ensure that Russia cannot invade in the future, and exactly everything which Russia opposes to make sure it can invade in the future.\n\nCHURCH: Tymofiy Mylovanov, thank you so much for joining us. I appreciate it.\n\nDonald Trump is pumping the brakes on auto tariffs against Canada and Mexico for the next month. But 25 percent tariffs on other imports from those countries will remain in place. Canadian leaders say the reprieve is not enough for them to lift reciprocal tariffs on U.S. goods. They want zero U.S. tariffs.\n\nMr. Trump says he made the decision after talking with executives from top U.S. automakers to protect them from financial harm. CNN's Kaitlan Collins asked the White House press secretary about the length of the tariff pause.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nKAITLAN COLLINS, CNN CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: On the reprieve that is being granted to these three automakers for one month on the tariffs on Canada and Mexico, how did the president settle on one month?\n\nKAROLINE LEAVITT, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The reciprocal tariffs will go into effect on April 2nd. And he feels strongly about that, no matter what, no exemption. So that's where the one month comes from.\n\nCOLLINS: Does he expect them to be able to shift production within a month?\n\nLEAVITT: He told them that they should get on it, start investing, start moving, shift production here to the United States of America where they will pay no tariff. That's the ultimate goal.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCHURCH: More now from CNN's Sherrell Hubbard.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nSHERRELL HUBBARD, CNN CONTRIBUTOR (voice-over): There's a trade war brewing. Canada is resorting to retaliatory measures a day after President Donald Trump doubled a tariff on Chinese goods to 20 percent and enacted a 25 percent tariff on Canada and Mexico.\n\nWAB KINEW, MANITOBA PREMIER: Pulling American booze off the liquor market shelves.\n\nHUBBARD (voice-over): Canada is also responding by imposing a 25 percent tariff on some U.S. goods, with plans to include more later. Trump spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Wednesday morning for almost an hour on the issue.\n\nLEAVITT: He said that he was not pleased, as you said. He said it's not good enough.\n\nHUBBARD (voice-over): The White House said the decision to pause auto tariffs is so that U.S. automakers are not at an economic disadvantage. But tariff news has sent stocks sinking and consumer confidence plunging this week.\n\nERASMUS KERSTING, DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMIC CHAIRMAN, VILLANOVA UNIVERSITY: They are just going to raise prices. There is a lot of cross-border traffic involved with the production of every single automobile.\n\nUNKNOWN: All of our wholesalers are letting us know, hey, the prices are going to go up.\n\nHUBBARD (voice-over): Although U.S. companies and consumers will ultimately be responsible for paying the tariffs, in his address to Congress Tuesday night, Trump spent several minutes doubling down on his tariff agenda.\n\nDONALD TRUMP, U.S. PRESIDENT: There'll be a little disturbance, but we're OK with that.\n\nHUBBARD (voice-over): I'm Sherrell Hubbard reporting.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nCHURCH: Still ahead, Donald Trump issues a stark new ultimatum to Hamas and its leadership. We'll have details on his message.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n[03:15:00]\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nCHURCH: At least 15 people are injured after the South Korean Air Force accidentally dropped bombs on a residential area. It happened in the city of Pocheon on Thursday during a live fire exercise with U.S. forces close to the demilitarized zone with North Korea.\n\nSouth Korean officials say eight bombs fell outside of the shooting range, destroying two residential buildings and part of a church. Two of the victims were seriously wounded.\n\nOfficials say initial findings suggest a pilot entered the wrong bombing coordinates. The city's mayor is calling for the military drill to be suspended immediately.\n\nFor what's believed to be the first time ever, the U.S. is negotiating directly with Hamas on the hostages and ceasefire in Gaza. This marks an abrupt change in policy for the United States, which for decades has refused to engage with groups it considers terrorists.\n\nThe U.S. declared Hamas a terrorist organization back in 1997. No comment yet from Hamas about the negotiations. The White House press secretary explained why the Trump administration is breaking with precedent.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nLEAVITT: The special envoy who's engaged in those negotiations does have the authority to talk to anyone. Israel was consulted on this matter.\n\nAnd look, dialogue and talking to people around the world to do what's in the best interest of the American people is something that the president has proven is what he believes is a good faith effort to do what's right for the American people.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n[03:20:04]\n\nCHURCH: Meanwhile, President Trump is warning, quote, \"there will be hell to pay if Hamas does not immediately release the remaining hostages.\" CNN's Jeremy Diamond reports on the new ultimatum and reaction from Hamas.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nJEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT: Well, President Trump is making a new effort to try and seek the release of the remaining hostages held in Gaza, issuing a fresh ultimatum to Hamas.\n\nIn a social media post, the president wrote, quote, \"release all of the hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered or it is over for you. Only sick and twisted people keep bodies and you are sick and twisted.\" The president goes on to say that he is going to, quote, \"be sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job and saying that not a single Hamas member will be safe if you don't do as I say.\"\n\nHe goes on to say that this is Hamas', quote, \"last warning\" and also issues a warning to the people of Gaza, saying that a beautiful future awaits you, but not if you hold hostages. If you do, quote, \"you are dead.\"\n\nThis certainly isn't the first time that we have heard this kind of tough language from the president being directed at Hamas regarding the remaining hostages being held in Gaza.\n\nBut this time it seems to come with a lot more meat on the bone and it also comes at a very delicate moment in this ongoing ceasefire. Phase one of this ceasefire agreement has been completed with the release of 33 Israeli hostages in exchange for more than 1,700 Palestinian prisoners.\n\nBut now we are in the delicate stage where the U.S. and Israel are both trying to pressure Hamas not to get into phases two and three of that deal, which would lead to the withdrawal of Israeli troops and the end of the war in Gaza, but instead are trying to impose new conditions on Hamas.\n\nWe know that Israel has put forward this new proposal to see six or seven more weeks of ceasefire in exchange for the release of half of the remaining living and dead hostages being held in Gaza.\n\nAnd now President Trump, with this ultimatum to release all of the hostages immediately or effectively face the wrath of a U.S.-backed Israeli military resuming its war in Gaza. Israel has already begun to block humanitarian aid into Gaza as an effort to pressure Hamas, one that has drawn immense criticism from the international community and human rights groups who have called that a violation of international law.\n\nAnd now clearly there is also very much the specter of the Israeli military recommencing its fight in Gaza amid this latest from the president.\n\nHamas is already firing back. The spokesman for Hamas, Hassam Qassem, says that these threats quote, \"complicate matters regarding the ceasefire agreement and encourage the occupation government,\" meaning Israel, \"not to implement the agreement.\"\n\nHe is then calling on the U.S. administration to instead pressure Israel to enter the phase two of the ceasefire agreement, as was previously scheduled.\n\nWe've also now learned that the United States has been holding direct conversations with Hamas. Adam Boehler, the special envoy for hostage affairs for the United States, has met with Hamas officials in Qatar, according to a report from Axios.\n\nThat was effectively confirmed by the White House press secretary, who said that Israel was consulted on this matter and that the talks are quote, \"ongoing,\" but that she would not get into the details. This would be the first time that the United States has engaged in direct talks with Hamas, as far as we know.\n\nJeremy Diamond, CNN, Tel Aviv.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE) CHURCH: The Vatican has released a new statement on Pope Francis as he fights double pneumonia in hospital. CNN senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman has details from Rome, he joins us now.\n\nSo Ben, what is the latest update on the Pope's health?\n\nBEN WEDEMAN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, what we saw is this one-line statement from the Vatican saying that the night passed peacefully and the Pope is still resting on now this 21st day of his stay here in Rome's Gemelli Hospital. Now, yesterday they described his health condition as stable, but it remains complex in their words. By day, he, the Pope, is receiving oxygen through the nose.\n\nAt night, he puts on a mask, an oxygen mask, which allows him to sleep more peacefully. At night, a Vatican official telling CNN yesterday that his illness is progressing normally, we assume normally for an 88-year-old man who has a history of respiratory problems.\n\nBut the doctor's prognosis remains, in their words, guarded. In other words, it's not quite clear how soon the Pope will recover from this case of double pneumonia, Rosemary.\n\n[03:25:08]\n\nCHURCH: And Ben, despite the Pope's health problems, he's been keeping up his relationship with a priest in Gaza. What can you tell us about that?\n\nWEDEMAN: Yes, this is Gabriele Romanelli, who is the parish priest in Gaza. And Pope Francis, before he fell ill, tried almost every night to call Gaza.\n\nIt's a simple act of compassion, kindness, and concern, certainly at a time when other world leaders are either turning their back on Gaza, simply not worried about it anymore, or in the case of an American president who's engaging in infantile gimmicks like putting out, posting on social media, an A.I.-generated fantasy video about turning Gaza into a beach resort for the wealthy, seeming grotesquely unaware that the sands of Gaza are soaked with the blood and littered with the bones of tens of thousands of people after 517 days of war there. Rosemary.\n\nCHURCH: Ben Wedeman, reporting there from Rome. Many thanks for that.\n\nWell, still to come, President Trump is touting a major investment in the U.S. by Taiwanese chipmaker. But in Taiwan, people are worried the deal could weaken their own security. We'll take a look at that. Stay with us.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n[03:30:00]\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back to \"CNN Newsroom.\" I am Rosemary Church. I want to check today's top stories for you.\n\nEuropean leaders will soon gather in Brussels for a critical summit focusing on defending Ukraine as well as strengthening defenses across all of Europe, as they face the new reality of a U.S. administration that is no longer a reliable security partner. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be among those attending.\n\nU.S. officials say Washington has paused at least some of its intelligence sharing with Ukraine, but they suggest it could be short- lived if U.S. President Donald Trump is satisfied that Kyiv is taking serious steps toward negotiations with Russia.\n\nPresident Trump is granting a one-month exemption to Canada and Mexico on auto tariffs. He says he doesn't want to hurt U.S. automakers financially. The White House says companies should take that time to start shifting production to the U.S., where they won't pay tariffs.\n\nIn his address to Congress Tuesday, President Trump touted a decision by Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC to invest at least $100 billion in its U.S. manufacturing.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDONALD TRUMP, U.S. PRESIDENT: Taiwan Semiconductor, the biggest in the world, most powerful in the world, has a tremendous amount, 97 percent of the market, announced a $165 billion investment to build the most powerful chips on earth, right here in the USA.\n\nAll that was important to them was they didn't want to pay the tariffs so they came and they're building and many other companies are coming. We have to give more money.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCHURCH: But the massive investment plan is raising concerns in Taiwan over its security, especially given China's aggression against the island. Taiwan heavily relies on its semiconductor industry as a strategic asset.\n\nAnd we get more on all of this from CNN senior international correspondent Will Ripley.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nWILL RIPLEY, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: President Trump got a lot of applause when he mentioned what TSMC says will be the largest foreign direct investment in U.S. history. A total of $165 billion to build new fabrication plants, advanced packaging facilities and a research and development center in the United States.\n\nTSMC, of course, produces most of the world's advanced chips and they have an ecosystem in Taiwan that they've been developing for decades. It has taken Taiwan a long time to get people with the expertise, the knowledge, and the military-like discipline to manufacture these chips at a faster and more efficient pace than pretty much anywhere else in the world. Taiwan really is light years ahead, and the Taiwanese people have long felt that TSMC provides their self-ruling democracy with a silicon shield protecting them from the threat of Chinese attack because, frankly, the product that they're exporting to the world that powers things like cell phones and cars and laptops is just too important a supply chain that cannot be disrupted.\n\nThey feel like if this technology moved to the United States, that could potentially put Taiwan's security at risk.\n\n[03:34:57]\n\nThe Taiwanese government and presidential office trying to dissuade those concerns, they put out a statement saying, quote, \"the government will review the proposed investment in accordance with law to ensure the interests of shareholders and the nation,\" and \"that TSMC keeps its most advanced production technology in Taiwan as it expands its footprint into the U.S.\"\n\nBut some in Taiwan's opposition parties are outraged. They say that this is going to put their island at risk, and that was a feeling and a sentiment shared by some people that we spoke with on the streets of Taipei.\n\nUNKNOWN: Trump is flipping the whole world upside down, and TSMC is Taiwan's treasure. I don't feel safe. I feel when the time comes, Trump is a dealer, right? He's a businessman.\n\nSo he'll deal Taiwan. Taiwan, pretty soon, just like he said to Zelenskyy, you have no cards to play, and Taiwan not going to have cards to play. TSMC was the best card.\n\nUNKNOWN (through translator): Everyone wants to know the secret recipe of TSMC. If TSMC's confidential technologies are taken away by others, Taiwan won't have its edge, and that would pose a security problem for Taiwan.\n\nRIPLEY: President Trump insists that this deal strengthens America and protects the supply chain with more advanced chips being produced in the U.S. Of course, for Taiwanese, that gives them little comfort because they feel like it could make their island and their economy all the more vulnerable, especially after watching what's been happening with Ukraine.\n\nWill Ripley, CNN, New York.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nCHURCH: Republican lawmakers are privately pushing Elon Musk for control over sweeping cuts to the federal workforce and spending.\n\nThe world's richest man met with congressional Republicans behind closed doors on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. One Republican said Musk acknowledged making some mistakes while carrying out the Trump administration's efforts to shrink the federal government. But another lawmaker said Musk blamed the widespread firings on federal department heads. House Speaker Mike Johnson says they discussed a legislative package that would codify the cuts. When asked, Musk told CNN that Congress should have a vote on how the cuts are made.\n\nWell the Trump administration is planning to cut more than 70,000 jobs at the Department of Veterans Affairs. That's according to a memo which states the V.A. is working with Musk's DOGE team to aggressively restructure. The memo says the V.A. will revert back to staffing levels from 2019 when it employed fewer than 400,000 people.\n\nThe V.A. grew under the Biden administration mainly to help implement the PACT Act. That legislation, signed into law in 2022 by then- President Biden, helped expand coverage to millions of veterans who were exposed to toxins and hazards while serving. A letter from two congressional lawmakers from Maine says the Trump administration has already fired nearly 2,500 employees at the V.A.\n\nWell earlier, I spoke with Larry Sabato. He is the director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. I asked him about all those jobs being cut at Veterans Affairs where many of the employees are veterans themselves.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nLARRY SABATO, DIRECTOR, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA-CENTER FOR POLITICS: They're trying to say, oh, we're just cutting back to the level it was during President Trump's first term before it got bloated under President Biden, who, as you know, according to Trump, is the worst president in American history.\n\nThe attacks on Biden were really over the top, 12 of them during one State of the Union speech. But I just don't think that his veteran base, and he does have the support of lots of veterans, will appreciate this one bit.\n\nThere's going to be a lot of blowback. And one thing I've learned about veterans over the years, whether they're organized or not, they speak out and they have credibility because of the service they gave to the country. So Trump should watch out there.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCHURCH: Some federal employees whose jobs were slashed in mass DOGE firings are experiencing a type of whiplash.\n\nAt the U.S. Department of Agriculture, a Workers Protection Board is at least temporarily reinstating almost 6,000 fire-probationary workers who were fired on February 13. The board's order indicates the mass firings were unlawful and may eventually be reversed.\n\nMeantime, at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a senior official tells CNN a small portion of the employees who were fired have received a notice of reinstatement. But one worker who was fired and rehired tells CNN it appears dozens of employees were asked to return. Some have refused because of what they described as the unstable environment at the agency.\n\n[03:40:00]\n\nWell the U.S. Supreme Court has rejected the Trump administration's request to keep frozen billions of dollars in foreign aid that has already been approved by Congress. But the court did not say when the money must be released, sending the issue back to lower courts.\n\nBack in January, the president moved to freeze foreign aid from the State Department and USAID, causing aid programs around the world to grind to a halt. But the effects are also being felt by American farmers who relied on USAID to purchase their product and distribute it overseas.\n\nCNN's Shimon Prokupecz has more.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nJOHN BOYD JR., 4TH GENERATION FARMER, AND FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, NATIONAL BLACK FARMERS ASSOCIATION: You ask me why I do it? We feed people. And that's a good feeling.\n\nWhat I produce here, I stand behind my crop. I don't produce anything on my farm that I wouldn't eat. Matter of fact, I'll show you, I'll chew some soybeans for you.\n\nIt tastes good. I grew them right here on my farm.\n\nSHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN SR. CRIME AND JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: What does it taste like?\n\nBOYD JR.: It tastes like McDonald's hamburger.\n\nPROKUPECZ: No.\n\nBOYD JR.: Yes. That's what's in them.\n\nPROKUPECZ (voice-over): John Boyd Jr. is a fourth-generation farmer. He grows wheat, corn, and soybeans here on his 1,000-acre farm in southern Virginia. He also founded the National Black Farmers Association.\n\nAnd he's no fan of President Donald Trump.\n\nBOYD JR.: The president casts a net of uncertainty. Every time he makes one of these wild announcements that people are saying, yay, tariffs to China, tariffs to Mexico, tariffs to Canada, USAID, it's over, it's done. Every time he makes those type of drastic announcements, he affects America's farmers.\n\nPROKUPECZ (voice-over): Within days of taking office, President Trump dismantled USAID, a humanitarian program that's been a lifeline for the most vulnerable around the world, and a critical source of income for U.S. farmers, paying them hundreds of millions of dollars a year for their crops. He also froze some funding for farmers and rattled trade markets. BOYD JR.: We take it totally, totally for granted. And what we're doing in this country right now, we're gambling with all that.\n\nPROKUPECZ: Gambling with farmers.\n\nBOYD JR.: Gambling with farmers' lives. To gamble with my life, to gamble with my livelihood, man.\n\nPROKUPECZ (voice-over): Farmers like Boyd rely on loans to plant for the upcoming season, with the hope that the harvest will pay it off and bring home some profit.\n\nIn fact, about a million American farmers rely on the USDA for financial assistance every year. But just days before planting season starts, Boyd says he hasn't been able to get a loan yet. And he says he's not the only one.\n\nBOYD JR.: They want to hear, they want you to show them on paper how you're good for that operating loan and how you're going to pay it back. I can't pay it back with $8 beans and $6 beans and $3 corn.\n\nPROKUPECZ (voice-over): The majority of grain exported from the United States is stored in grain elevators. In Kansas alone, one grain elevator can export millions of dollars of goods.\n\nThis is in Pawnee County in Kansas. This is a grain elevator site.\n\nPROKUPECZ: This is where farmers will bring their grain, stuff that they've harvested, like milo and wheat and soybean and corn. It is stored in these bins, these large concrete bins, and then sold to exporters, companies who are willing to buy that. And right now, it is very difficult to move some of this stuff.\n\nKIM BARNES, CEO, PAWNEE COUNTY COOPERATIVE ASSOCIATION: They could come in and sell wheat for $5.58. It was down 14 cents today.\n\nPROKUPECZ (voice-over): Kim Barnes has been buying and selling each year's harvest for Kansas farmers for over 50 years.\n\nBARNES: All these bins are full and they're full of milo.\n\nPROKUPECZ (voice-over): That's $5 million worth of grain, Barnes says. Grain that countries like Ethiopia and others depend on for food aid.\n\nPROKUPECZ: And so what's going on with the milo? Why do you have so much of that right now? What are you seeing in the market?\n\nBARNES: We just don't have any market for it. There's nobody wanting to buy it.\n\nPROKUPECZ (voice-over): Five months ago, Barnes says USAID bought over 200 million metric tons of milo from American farmers. Today, with no market for that grain, he's desperate. One potential lifeline, a proposal in Washington for the USDA to continue USAID's food distribution program.\n\nPROKUPECZ: You're optimistic that the USAID stuff will get moved into the USDA and the program will get --\n\nBARNES: And will go on.\n\nPROKUPECZ (voice-over): But John Boyd doesn't share that optimism. He's not just worried about the future of farming, but for the future of his own farm.\n\nBOYD JR.: I have four children. And I know that my kids have watched me scuffle, you know, throughout my career.\n\nAnd they're not going to want to do this if this administration continues to make it more difficult than it already is.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n[03:45:04]\n\nCHURCH: Some might consider it a king-size job, keeping alliances alive as tensions grow over Ukraine.

Three times in the past week, stepping in on delicate manoeuvers between the U.S. and its allies.\n\nDespite the traditionally apolitical role of the monarch, the U.K. hopes to leverage one of its greatest assets when it comes to President Trump. His fascination with the monarchy.\n\nThe king's invitation for a rare second state visit was delivered to the president by the British Prime Minister Keir Starmer last week, ahead of some tough discussions with the White House on Ukraine.\n\nKEIR STARMER, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: This is really special. This has never happened before. This is unprecedented.\n\nTRUMP: He's a beautiful man, a wonderful man.\n\nFOSTER (voice-over): Just days later, the king invited Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to his country residence in a show of solidarity and an indication of the king's fragile yet influential role at this tense moment.\n\nHUGO VICKERS, ROYAL BIOGRAPHER AND AUTHOR OF \"THE CROWN DISSECTED\": He's dying to do good and to be a conciliator and to help things along. And he's in a very good position to do it. I think the meeting last Sunday, I would say, passed off extremely well.\n\nFOSTER (voice-over): Charles has long appeared to side with Ukraine over the war, recently calling Russia's invasion as an indescribable aggression and unprovoked attack.\n\nKING CHARLES III, UNITED KINGDOM: We've all been worried about you and thinking about your country for so long.\n\nFOSTER (voice-over): But now, having to play a delicate dance with Trump as the U.K. and Europe try to keep him on side, the king also found himself confronted by another U.S. dispute when he hosted Canada's prime minister, Justin Trudeau, this week.\n\nAs Trump slapped tariffs on Canada and declared it should become the 51st state of America, the king, as Canada's ceremonial head of state, again caught between two allies.\n\nThe late Queen Elizabeth, Charles' mother, was one of the few global figures Trump seemed to show real deference to in his last term as president. So this new era of the relationship between Charles and Trump will be a real test for the monarch.\n\nVICKERS: He's met many, many world leaders. He's got a lot to offer, just as the queen did.\n\nFOSTER (voice-over): Their first official meeting five years ago was rumored to have not been an instant success.\n\nNIGEL FARAGE, U.K. REFORM PARTY LEADER: You had a meeting with Charles.\n\nTRUMP: I did.\n\nFARAGE: It was reported by one of your former press secretaries that you were somewhat bored by the meeting.\n\nTRUMP: That I was?\n\nFARAGE: Yes.\n\nTRUMP: No, I wasn't bored. I liked Charles. I thought he was great.\n\nNo, he's an environmentalist. He talked about the environment most of the meeting, which was fine.\n\nFOSTER (voice-over): No date set as yet for Trump's second state visit to the U.K., but when it does happen, we can expect the whole royal family to come out in full force to meet the president.\n\nFOSTER: In the 14 years I've been reporting regularly on the British royal family, I have never seen them roll out the red carpet like they are for Donald Trump this time round.\n\nKing Charles even offering to fly up to Scotland whilst the president is playing golf there so they can discuss how they can both get the most out of this unprecedented second state visit.

        "Story":"Taiwan Says TSMC Investment 'Historic Moment' For US TiesTaiwanese chipmaking giant TSMC's plan to invest $100 billion in the United States was a \"historic moment\" for Taiwan-US ties, the island's President Lai Ching-te said on Thursday. Taiwanese chipmaking giant TSMC's plan to invest $100 billion in the United States was a \"historic moment\" for Taiwan-US ties, the island's President Lai Ching-te said on Thursday.\n\nTSMC, the world's largest chipmaker, announced the plan this week after US President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on overseas-made chips.\n\nIt will take the total amount TSMC has pledged to invest in the United States to $165 billion, which the company said was the \"largest single foreign direct investment in US history\".\n\nThis was a \"historic moment for Taiwan-US relations\", Lai said in a joint news conference with TSMC chairman and chief executive C.C. Wei at the Presidential Office.\n\nIt comes after Trump's accusations that Taiwan stole the US chip industry and his threats to impose tariffs of up to 100 percent, as well as Taipei's promises to invest more in the United States.\n\nTSMC has long faced demands to move more of its production away from Taiwan, with fears that supplies of the critical technology could be disrupted in any conflict with Beijing.\n\nTrump recently ratcheted up the pressure on TSMC and other chip manufacturers by publicly mulling the introduction of 25 percent, or higher, tariffs on all chips made outside the United States.\n\nSpeaking Thursday, Lai said the government was not pressured by Washington \"during TSMC's US investment process\".\n\nWei said TSMC's expansion was driven by growing demand from US clients and it would not affect the company's investments in Taiwan.\n\nTSMC planned to build 11 new production lines in Taiwan this year to meet demand, Wei said, adding \"our production capacity is not enough\".\n\n\"Each time TSMC makes a strategic move, TSMC becomes stronger and more competitive\", Lai said.\n\n\"At the same time, it also provides Taiwanese enterprises with opportunities for international cooperation and contributes to Taiwan's greater strength.\"\n\nTaiwan is a global powerhouse in semiconductor manufacturing, with more than half of the world's chips and nearly all of the high-end ones made there.\n\nThe concentration of chip manufacturing in Taiwan has long been seen as a \"silicon shield\" protecting it from an invasion or blockade by China -- and an incentive for the United States to defend it.\n\nChina has upped military pressure on Taiwan in recent years to press its claim of sovereignty over the self-ruled island, where TSMC has its headquarters and the bulk of its fabrication plants.\n\nThe views expressed in content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex et al.

Wei announced last Monday a $100 billion investment for the construction of three new fabs, two advanced chip packaging facilities and a \"major\" research and development center in the United States.\n\nThis amount is in addition to another $65 billion in investment already committed by TSMC in Phoenix, Arizona, where it owns a plant that recently began operations and plans to open two additional plants in 2028 and 2030.\n\nTSMC controls around 90% of the global market for advanced semiconductor manufacturing, essential for US companies such as Nvidia or Apple and technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nFollowing the announcement of this new investment, Taiwanese Minister of Economic Affairs J.W. Kuo flatly denied that TSMC's most advanced manufacturing processes will be coming to the North American country anytime soon.\n\n\"I guarantee it: the 2-nanometer and 1.6-nanometer processes will not come to the United States next year,\" the official asserted regarding these technologies, which are scheduled to begin mass production in Taiwan between 2025 and 2026.

        "Story":"Taiwan's Taishin Bank sees growth from TSMC expansion in JapanTaishin Bank President Lin Shu-chen said Wednesday the company may establish a third branch in Kumamoto should TSMC expand operations in Japan.\n\nLin said at an investor's conference that overseas branches are profitable, realizing gains within two to three years, per CNA. The company operates two overseas branches in Japan, one in Tokyo and a sub-branch in Fukuoka, launched last year.\n\nLin added that semiconductor sector shifts towards Kyushu could also warrant a third branch, possibly in Kumamoto or Kansai. As for its Ho Chi Minh City representative office, regulations have made upgrading it to a full branch more challenging, and the bank is awaiting further notification from the Vietnamese authorities, per Anue.\n\nRegarding whether Taishin Bank will follow TSMC in expanding to the US, Taishin Holdings President Lin Wei-cun said the bank's focus is on the Asia-Pacific. However, following the merger with Shin Kong Financial, Taishin's asset size will elevate it to Taiwan's fourth-largest financial holding company, at which point it will consider expanding globally.\n\nTaishin Financial Holding reported an annual after-tax net profit of NT$20.06 billion (US$610.89 million) last year, reflecting 37.4% year-over-year growth, with earnings per share of NT$1.39."

        "Story":"TSMC Unveils $100bn US Chip Investment to Appease Trump AdministrationTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has announced a massive $100 billion investment in the United States, marking a strategic move to strengthen its foothold in the American semiconductor industry and avoid potential tariffs under President Donald Trump's administration. The decision, which expands TSMC's existing plans for chip fabrication plants in Arizona, underscores the growing pressure on global tech companies to increase domestic production in the face of escalating trade tensions.\n\nAt a news conference alongside TSMC CEO CC Wei, Trump emphasized the significance of the investment, calling it the 'largest single foreign direct investment in US history.' The move is seen as a direct response to Trump's threats to impose tariffs-potentially as high as 50%-on imported chips, a measure that could have severely impacted Taiwan's economy.\n\nTSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, confirmed that it would build three additional semiconductor fabrication plants (fabs) in the US, supplementing one that is set to start production this year and two more previously planned. The company will also establish two advanced packaging facilities, a crucial step in the semiconductor production process, as well as a research and development center.\n\nWei said the expansion would generate between 20,000 and 25,000 jobs and strengthen America's position in artificial intelligence and advanced computing. 'This will create hundreds of billions of dollars in economic activity and boost America's dominance in artificial intelligence and beyond,' Trump added.\n\nAccording to Financial Times, TSMC's move aligns with Trump's broader push to bring manufacturing back to the US. In recent weeks, several companies-including Apple, which pledged over $500 billion in US investments-have taken steps to appease the administration and avoid trade penalties.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick acknowledged that TSMC's initial $65 billion investment was partly motivated by Biden-era subsidies but credited Trump's policies for the additional $100 billion commitment. '[Companies] are coming here in huge size because they want to be in the greatest market in the world, and they want to avoid the tariffs,' Lutnick said.\n\nTSMC's American customers, including AMD and Nvidia, have welcomed the investment. AMD CEO Lisa Su called the move 'extremely important' for the US semiconductor industry, noting that TSMC will begin producing its highest-performance chips in the US later this year.\n\nTSMC's dominance in chip manufacturing, with over 90% of the market share for cutting-edge semiconductors, has made it a critical player in the ongoing US-China tech rivalry. The company's decision to significantly expand in the US comes amid Trump's repeated accusations that Taiwan has 'stolen' the US semiconductor business.\n\nDuring his presidential campaign and since taking office, Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose steep tariffs on chip imports, putting immense pressure on TSMC to increase its US presence. Additionally, the company has been wary of losing subsidies promised under Biden, which amount to more than $6 billion in support for its US operations.\n\nThe investment announcement follows reports that Trump administration officials have been pushing for TSMC to further integrate into the US market. Proposals have included a potential partnership with Intel, which has struggled to keep up with TSMC in advanced chip manufacturing. Some suggestions even involved TSMC taking an equity stake in Intel or spinning off its US operations into a separate entity with US government backing.\n\nAs the semiconductor industry becomes increasingly central to geopolitical tensions, TSMC's $100 billion investment in the US highlights the delicate balance between business strategy and international politics. While the move solidifies America's chipmaking capabilities, it also signals Taiwan's efforts to navigate an unpredictable trade landscape under Trump's administration."

Wei (R), speak to journalists at the White House Image: GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA\/AFP\n\nBy Amber WANG\n\nTAIPEI-Taiwanese chip-making giant TSMC plans to invest a whopping $100 billion in the United States, after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to slap tariffs on overseas-made chips.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is the world's biggest maker of the critical technology that has become the lifeblood of the global economy.\n\nThis week's announcement takes the total amount TSMC has pledged to invest in the United States to $165 billion, which the company says is the \"largest single foreign direct investment in U.S. history\".\n\nIt follows Trump's accusations that Taiwan stole the U..S chip industry and his threats to impose tariffs of up to 100 percent \u2014 and Taipei's promises to invest more in the United States.\n\nAFP looks at what TSMC's investment could mean for Taiwan.\n\n'Silicon shield'\n\nSemiconductor chips are used in everything from smartphones and televisions to electric vehicles and missiles \u2014 and more than half of them are made in Taiwan.\n\nThe concentration of chip manufacturing on the island has long been seen as a \"silicon shield\" protecting it from an invasion or blockade by China \u2014 and an incentive for the United States to defend it.\n\nChina has upped military pressure on Taiwan in recent years to press its claim of sovereignty over the self-ruled island, where TSMC has its headquarters and the bulk of its fabrication plants.\n\nThat has fueled calls for the firm to move more of its production off the island to avoid supply disruptions if China did attack.\n\nTrump recently warned of import levies of 25 percent, or higher, on overseas-made chips, which one analyst has said could trigger a recession in the industry.\n\nWhile TSMC's latest investment might deflect the threat of tariffs, there are fears it could hurt Taiwan's economy and weaken its \"silicon shield\".\n\n\"The more TSMC produces in the United States, the less important Taiwan will be in geopolitics and the less incentives the United States will have to help Taiwan in the future,\" said Ko Ju-chun, a lawmaker with the main opposition Kuomintang party.\n\nControl of TSMC\n\nTaiwan's leaders are aware of the risks as they try to stay onside with their most important security backer Washington and protect the island's status as a chip-making powerhouse.\n\nPresident Lai Ching-te's office said Tuesday the government would review TSMC's deal \"in accordance with the law\" and ensure that the \"most advanced\" chip-making processes stayed in Taiwan.\n\nTSMC had already pledged to invest more than $65 billion in three factories in the U.S. state of Arizona, one of which began production in late 2024.\n\nThe $100 billion investment will be used to expand its U.S. footprint further, with three new fabrication plants, two advanced packaging facilities and a research and development team centre.\n\nRichard Hu, deputy director of the Taiwan Center for Security Studies think tank, said Trump wanted to prevent TSMC from falling into China's hands and to make it a \"technological asset of the United States\".\n\n\"Trump's ultimate goal is to ensure that the U.S. can fully or critically control TSMC's semiconductor production, making it a de facto part of America's chip industry,\" Hu said.\n\nDefense guarantees\n\nTaipei security analyst Su Tzu-yun was more optimistic, telling AFP that TSMC's investment would make Taiwan \"safer\" and help grow the chip industry.\n\nIt would also build trust between Taipei and Washington, and ease Trump's concerns about U.S. economic security, said Su, from the Institute for National Defense and Security Research.\n\n\"I think the importance of Taiwan is not only TSMC but also the geostrategy,\" Su said, noting the importance of global shipping lanes near Taiwan.\n\nHowever, James Yifan Chen of Tamkang University said higher manufacturing costs in the United States would drive up prices of products using TSMC chips.\n\nAnd there were no guarantees the investment would make Trump more inclined to defend Taiwan.\n\n\"The deal's effect on U.S. willingness to defend Taiwan is unclear,\" said Wen-Ti Sung, a nonresident fellow with the Atlantic Council's Global China Hub. \"It really depends on how Trump feels on any particular day, and whether Beijing will attempt to outbid Taiwan subsequently.\"\n\n\u00a9 2025 AFP\n\nhttps:\/www.japantoday.com\n\n\u00a9 2022 Yerepouni Daily News.

(Hsinchu, Taiwan) has been issued patent number 12223251, according to news reporting originating out of Alexandria, Virginia, by NewsRx editors.\n\nThe patent's inventors are Hsu, Chin-Chang (Hsinchu, TW), Lee, Hsien-Hsin Sean (Hsinchu, TW), Tsai, Nien-Yu (Hsinchu, TW), Yang, Wen-Ju (Hsinchu, TW).\n\nThis patent was filed on July 19, 2023 and was published online on February 11, 2025.\n\nFrom the background information supplied by the inventors, news correspondents obtained the following quote: \"In semiconductor fabrication processes, when features in a single layer of a semiconductor device are positioned closer than patterning resolution permits, multiple masks are often used in order to pattern the features. The features of the single layer of the semiconductor device are separated into different masks so that each mask includes features which are separated by a distance equal to or greater than a patterning resolution parameter. In some instances, a process using two masks is called double patterning and a process using three masks is call triple patterning.\n\n\"While designing a semiconductor device, designers will lay out the features of the semiconductor device in a layout pattern. These layout patterns include commonly used structures which are stored as standard cells in a cell library. A cell library is a database of standard cells which a designer can use in order to efficiently insert commonly used structures in a layout pattern while avoiding the extra task of designing each structure for each different semiconductor device.\n\n\"In some instances, these standard cells are checked to determine whether the standard cell is colorable based on a number of masks used to form the single layer of the semiconductor device. A cell is colorable if the features of the cell are able to be separated into the number of masks with each mask maintaining a separation of the features greater than or equal to the patterning resolution parameter. For example, a standard cell which is compatible with a double patterning process is called 2-colorable, and a standard cell which is compatible with a triple patterning process is called 3-colorable.\"\n\nSupplementing the background information on this patent, NewsRx reporters also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: \"The following disclosure provides many different embodiments, or examples, for implementing different features of the provided subject matter. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting.

In addition, the present disclosure may repeat reference numerals and\/or letters in the various examples. This repetition is for the purpose of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and\/or configurations discussed.\n\n\"Further, spatially relative terms, such as \"beneath,\" \"below.\" \"lower.\" \"above,\" \"upper\" and the like, may be used herein for case of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures.

WEI: Thank you, Mr. Welcoming, from TSMC- which is the biggest there is, at a level that you can't even calculate, frankly- C.C. Wei, to the White House for a very historic announcement. Section: General News - THE PRESIDENT: Hello, everybody. Thank you very much.\n\nThank you very much. This is a very big day for a lot of reasons, but this gentleman is a very unique man. I think I can say, in the world of chips, certainly, but in the world pretty much of business, nobody has done what he's done. For those of you that are into that world, you would say, Wow, he's a legend. But he is a legend. And it's an honor to be with you. Very great honor. Thank you very much.\n\nMR. WEI: Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much.\n\nWelcoming, from TSMC - which is the biggest there is, at a level that you can't even calculate, frankly - C.C. Wei, to the White House for a very historic announcement. This is a tremendous thing for our country and, hopefully, for his company.\n\nWe're also pleased to be joined by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and White House AI and crypto czar, David Sacks, another two very highly respected people. It's great to have you guys involved. And, David, thank you very much for coming on.\n\nDavid is sort of the king of intellect in that world. We have some good people.\n\nToday, Taiwan Semiconductor is announcing that they will be investing at least $100 billion dollars in new capital in the United States over the next short period of time to build state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing facilities. I think, mostly, it's going to be in Arizona, which is what I understand, which is a great state. I like it because I won it. But I won most of them - (laughs) - actually. So - but I did. We won it, and we won it big.\n\nThe most powerful AI chips in the world will be made right here in America, and it'll be a big percentage of the chips made by his company. But, as you know, they're based mostly in Taiwan. And they're far and away the biggest. There's nobody even close.\n\nThis $100 billion in new investment will go into building five cutting-edge fabrication facilities in the great state that we just discussed, Arizona, and will create thousands of jobs - many thousands of jobs, and they're high-paying jobs.\n\nIn total, today's announcement brings Taiwan Semiconductor investments to about $165 billion - they've started already - among the largest new foreign direct investments in United States.\n\nApple, as you know, made a big announcement last week of $500 billion, and we have some others that have announced.\n\nWe have many that want to announce. But I don't have time to do all of these announcements, I tell you. But, for you, I'm doing the announcement.\n\nMR. WEI: Thank you.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: This will create hundreds of billions of dollars in economic activity and boost America's dominance in artificial intelligence and beyond.\n\nSemiconductors are the backbone of the 21st century economy - and, really, without the semiconductors, there is no economy - powering everything from AI to automobiles to advanced manufacturing. And we must be able to build the chips and semiconductors that we need right here, in American factories, with American skill and American labor. And that's exactly what we're doing.\n\nAs you know, Taiwan pretty much has a monopoly on that market. And I think pretty much is not a term that's even appropriate. They do have a monopoly. And this is a tremendous move by the most powerful company in the world.\n\nIt's a matter of economic security. It's also a matter of national security for us. And, at the same time, Mr. Wei will be able to diversify and have his tremendous presence in another place and a very safe place. And I want to thank Taiwan Semiconductor for doing the announcement.\n\nAnd I'd like to ask Mr. Wei to say a few words, if you might.\n\nAnd I'd also like to ask Howard and David - you can say a couple of words. But maybe you should go first because, right now, he's the most important man in the room. I'm sorry, fellas.\n\nPlease.\n\nThank you very much. Thank you. Great honor.\n\nMR. WEI: Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you.\n\nMR. WEI: I'm a - I'm a little bit nervous, so I have to pull out my piece of paper.\n\nMr. President, Secretary Lutnick - and, David, I didn't know that - your title, but - okay.\n\nFirst, I want to thank - say thank you to Mr. President to give me this opportunity to announce our big project in the U.S.\n\nTSMC is the world's largest chip manufacturing, founded by Dr. Morris Chang in 1987. It's now at the forefront of semiconductor technology, supporting AI advancement and industry growth.\n\nIn fact, I would like to wind back the time that in 2020 we have to thank President Trump's vision and his support. So, TSMC start the journey of establishing the advanced chip manufacturing in Arizona. And now, let me proudly say, now the vision become reality.\n\nIn Phoenix, Arizona, with 3,000 employees, we are producing the most advanced chip made on U.S. soil with the success of our first fab.\n\nSo, we are now very happy to announce we are going to invest additional 100 billion U.S. dollar in addition to our current 65-billion-U.S.-dollars investment in Arizona. We are going to build three more new fab - be- - after we promised the three fabs already, and another two very advanced packaging fab, and, most important, an R&D center, also in Arizona.\n\nFor this, all the investment - $165 billion - is going to create thousand of the high-paid job, as the president just announced. And we are, most important - actually, we are going to produce many AI chips. We are going to produce many chips to support AI's progress and to support the smartphone's progress.\n\nAnd, again, with that, I want to thank President Trump again for his support. In addition, I also want to thank my customers in the U.S., such as Apple, Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm, Broadcom. They all support TSMC's manufacturing in the U.S. Without their support, we probably cannot make it true.\n\nSo, again, I want to thank them. Also, I'd like to thank the TSMC's employee. Without their effort, we just cannot make it today.\n\nThat's all I want to say. And thank you.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you. That's great. (Applause.) Thank you very much.\n\nHoward, please. David.\n\nSECRETARY LUTNICK: Sure.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you.\n\nSECRETARY LUTNICK: So, I'm thrilled to be here today, because President Trump has made it a fundamental objective to bring semiconductor chip manufacturing home to America.\n\nUnder the Biden administration, TSMC received a $6 billion grant, and that encouraged them to build $65 billion. So, America gave TSMC 10 percent of the money to build here. And now you're seeing the power of Donald Trump's presidency, because TSMC, the greatest manufacturer of chips in the world, is coming to America with $100 billion investment. And, of course, that is backed by the fact that they can come here because they can avoid paying tariffs.\n\nSo, the idea is: Come to America. Build greatness in America. Build for the American customers - the Apple, Nvidia, that whole list that Chairman Wei gave - in order to bring production to America.\n\nSo, we're really, really excited. This continues the most incredible path you've ever seen, in these first weeks and months of the Trump administration, of incredible manufacturing coming to America. The keys that the president has called out are coming here. They're coming here in huge size because they want to be in the greatest market in the world, and they want to avoid the tariffs that, if they're not here, they'd have to suffer.\n\nSo, I want to congratulate C.C. Wei for bringing in this incredible $100 billion investment, but it's on the shoulders of our president, Donald Trump, which is why he's coming.\n\nSo, thank you.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you.\n\nDavid.\n\nMR. SACKS: Thank you, sir. Well, the products that TSMC makes are literally the most important products in the world. I mean, these advanced chips power everything. They power AI. They power your phone. They power your cars. And without them, the whole modern economy would stop, but they're not made in the United States.\n\nSo, for TSMC to move here is a huge, huge development, and we owe that to President Trump's leadership on the economy and Secretary Lutnick as well. And, C.C., thank you for - for coming here.\n\nThank you. Yeah.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you, David.\n\nSo, thank you very much. A big percentage of chips with this investment will be made now - a big percentage. Worldwide, we had very little. Almost none. We used to have a lot with Intel. But we had very little. And we'll be at close to 40 percent of the market with this transaction and a couple of others that we're doing. That's a tremendous leap - like, a leap that nobody would have really said was possible.\n\nSo, I just want to thank you all for being here. If you want a couple of questions.\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nQ On the -\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Ideally on this subject.\n\nYes, please.\n\nQ - specific number of jobs it will create. He said thousands -\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: They - yeah.\n\nQ - but do you have a better -\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: They - you're probably talking about 25,000 jobs. But it'll get bigger and bigger with time. Knowing this gentleman, it'll get bigger and bigger. There'll be no stopping him. (Laughs.)\n\nQ Mr. President, what more -\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Brian, go ahead.\n\nQ Right. In addition to the jobs, you talked about national security, and that's one thing I think a lot of Americans -\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yeah.\n\nQ - at home don't understand. Explain the national security aspect of this.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, without the chips and semiconductors, nothing runs today. You can't buy a car without them. You can't get a radio, a television, nothing - you can't get anything. And we thought it was very important - obviously, business was, but we thought even to terms of national security, to have this large percentage of the chips, semiconductors, and other things that they make - the most important product, and not a product that you can really copy. It takes years and years.\n\nYou're on the needle of a pin is total genius. I mean, they can put things - I mean, something the size of the needle, the point of a pin, they put information that is just not even believable.\n\nSo, if you would -\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nIf you would see this, it's just really something.\n\nYes, Brian.\n\nQ Can I - one - one more aspect to that. Honda -\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yeah.\n\nQ - announced they're coming to Indiana because of the tariffs. Once again -\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: That's right.\n\nQ - you're bringing additional jobs in manufacturing. Do you want to comment on that as well?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, Honda is coming, and I told you about Apple, that they're going to be starting to build massively here - $500 billion. And we have many other companies. It's going to be announced, but we had many that have already announced. And no, it's going to be great. It's looking - it's looking really strong. I don't think this country has ever seen anything like we're seeing right now.\n\nNow, the tariffs, as you know, it will start a week earlier than the reciprocal, which is going to be on - a couple of weeks earlier. Reciprocal tariffs start on April 2nd. And I wanted to make it April 1st, but I didn't want to do - I didn't want to go April Fool's Day - (laughter) - because that cost me - that costs a lot of money, but - that one day. So, we're going April 2nd.\n\nBut very importantly, tomorrow, tariffs - 25 percent on Canada and 25 percent on Mexico, and that'll start. So, they're going to have to have a tariff. So, what they'll have to do is build their car plants, frankly, and other things in the United States - in which case, they have no tariffs. In other words, you build - and this is exactly what Mr. Wei is doing by building here. Otherwise, they'll build - if they did them in Taiwan to send them here, they'll have 25 percent or 30 percent or 50 percent or whatever the number may be someday. It'll go only up. But by doing it here, he has no tariffs, so he's way ahead of the game.\n\nAnd I would just say this to people in Canada or Mexico, if they're going to build car plants, the people that are doing them are much better off building here, because we have the market. We're the market where they sell the most.\n\nAnd so, I think it's going to be very exciting. Very exciting for the automobile companies. Very exciting for - I can think of any - as an example, North Carolina, they had the great - I used to go there to buy furniture for hotels, and it's been wiped out. That business all went to other countries, and now it's all going to come back into North Carolina - the furniture manufacturing business.\n\nPlease.\n\nQ Mr. President -\n\nQ Is the Ukraine minerals deal now dead, or can it be revived? What - what's your -\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I'll let you know. We're making a speech - you probably heard about it - tomorrow night, so I'll let you know tomorrow night.\n\nBut, no, I don't think so. I think it's - look, it's a great deal for us, because, you know, Biden very, very, foolishly - stupidly, frankly - gave $300 billion and - $350 billion, more accurately - to a country to fight and to try and do things. And you know what happened? We get nothing. We get nothing - just gave it.\n\nWe could have rebuilt our entire U.S. Navy with $350 billion. Think of it. Three hundred and fifty billion, we could have rebuilt our U.S. Navy.\n\nSo, he gave it away as fast as the money could be gone. And what we're doing is getting that all back and a lot more than that. And what we need - it's very important for this business that we're talking about here, with chips and semiconductors and everything else - we need rare earths. And the deal we have is we have the finest rare earths that you can.\n\nQ Sir, on Ukraine. Sir, on Ukraine.\n\nQ Are you going to press back -\n\nQ Thank you, Mr. President. What do you need to see from President Zelenskyy to restart these negotiations?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I just think he should be more appreciative, because this country has stuck with them through thick and thin. We've given them much more than Europe, and Europe should have given more than us, because, as you know, that's right there. That's the border.\n\nThis country really was like the fence on the border. It was very important to Europe. And I'm not knocking Europe, I'm saying they're just - they were a lot smarter than Joe Biden, because Joe Biden didn't have a clue. He just gave money hand over a fist, and they should have been able to equalize with us.\n\nIn other words, if we gave a dollar, they should have given. Well, we gave $350 billion. They probably gave 100, but on top of it all, they get their money back, because they are doing it in the form of a loan, and it's a secured loan.\n\nSo, when I saw that, which I've known about for a little while, I said, It's time for us to be smart. At the same time, it's great for them, because they get us in the country taking the rare earth, which is going to fuel this big engine, and especially the engine that we've, in a very short time, created. And we get something, and we're in the - we're there. We have a presence there.\n\nWith all of that being said, I want one thing to happen: I want all of those young people to stop being killed. They're being killed by the thousands every single week. Last week, 2,700 were killed. Twenty-seven hundred young - in this case, just about, all young boys from Ukraine and from Russia. And that's not young people from the United States, but it's on a human basis.\n\nI want to see it stop. The money is one thing, but the death. And they're losing thousands of soldiers a week, and that's not including the people that get killed every time a town goes down or a missile goes into a town.\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nWe - and - and I want to see it stop.\n\nYes.\n\nQ Mr. President, are you considering canceling military aid to Ukraine? And can we get a reaction to what the Kremlin just said, that your administration is bringing U.S. worldview in alignment with Moscow's?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: So, this is a deal that should have never happened. This is a deal that would have never happened, and it didn't happen - for four years, it didn't happen. It was never even close to happening. If I were president, would not have happened. And October 7th would have - would not have happened in Israel. And inflation wouldn't have happened.\n\nAnd Afghanistan, disastrous - the way they withdrew - not the fact that they withdrew but the way they withdrew - would have never happened. And we would have had Bagram right now instead of China having it. It was one hour away from where China makes their nuclear weapons. We would have kept Bagram - one of the biggest air bases in the world.\n\nAll of these things happened, and it's a shame. But it is what it is, and now we're here. I want to see it end fast. I don't want to see this go on for years and years.\n\nNow, President Zelenskyy supposedly made a statement today in AP - I'm not a big fan of AP, so maybe it was an incorrect statement - but he said he thinks the war is going to go on for a long time, and he better not be right about that. That's all I'll say.\n\nQ Mr. President, is there any -\n\nQ Could this project - could this minimize the impact of the U.S. with chips should China decide to isolate Taiwan or China decide to take Taiwan?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, it's a very interesting point. It's a great question, actually. But this would certainly - I can't say minimize. That would be a catastrophic event, obviously. But it will at least give us a position where we have - in this very, very important business, we would have a very big part of it in the United States. So, it would have a big impact if something should happen with Taiwan.\n\nQ And with Russia sanctions, are you looking at relieving Russian sanctions if there is a peace deal?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, we're going to make deals with everybody to get this war, including Europe and European nations. And they've acted very well. You know, they're good people. I know; most of them are friends of mine - the heads of state, the heads of the various countries, prime ministers from the different - I got four prime ministers and five presidents called me over the last two days, and they want to work it out. They want to get it worked out.\n\nAnd I think they're also - you know, they're talking money, but the money is less important than the deaths. We're talking thousands of young people a week. And people would say why do I care about Ukraine, young people; why do I care about - and not all young, but they're pretty young. You know, Ukraine is running a little bit low, and they're getting older. They're recruiting older people. It's a very, very sad thing that's happening over there, and we want to get it finished. We want to stop the death.\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nQ Mr. President, on the tariffs. Is there any room left for Canada and Mexico to make a deal before midnight? And should we expect those Chinese tariffs, the extra 10 percent to take effect tomorrow?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: No room left for Mexico or for Canada. No, the tariffs, you know, they're all set. They go into effect tomorrow.\n\nQ Mr. President, just a follow-up on my colleague's question. Hearing -\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: And just so you understand, vast amounts of fentanyl have poured into our country from Mexico and, as you know, also from China, where it goes to Mexico and goes to Canada. And China also had an additional 10, so it's 10 plus 10.\n\nAnd it comes in from Canada, and it comes in from Mexico, and that's a very important thing to say.\n\nYeah, please. Go ahead.\n\nQ Have you decided if you're going to suspend military aid to Ukraine? Have you made that decision?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I haven't even talked about that right now. I mean, right now, we'll see what happens. A lot of things are happening right now, as we speak - I mean, literally as we speak. I could give you an answer and go back to my office - the beautiful Oval Office. I could go back into the Oval Office and find out that the answer is obsolete.\n\nIt's like his business. It's obsolete. You come up with a new chip, and it's obsolete about two minutes later, right? But that's what's good about his business. That's why he's the only one that's successful in it. But -\n\nQ And on tariffs, sir.\n\nQ Mr. President, just to follow up my colleague's question from Russia is saying that your foreign policy is largely in line with their vision. Should that be concerning to Americans?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Said what?\n\nQ Should that be concerning to Americans?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Read the statement.\n\nQ That Russia - Russia says that your administration's foreign policy is, quote, largely in line with their vision.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I tell you what, I think it takes two to tango, and you're going to have to make a deal with Russia, and you're going to have to make a deal with Ukraine. You're going to have to have the ascent, and you're going to have to have the consent from the European nations, because I think that's important, and from us.\n\nI think everybody has to get into a room, so to speak, and we have to make a deal. And the deal could be made very fast. It should not be that hard a deal to make. It could be made very fast.\n\nNow, maybe somebody doesn't want to make a deal, and if somebody doesn't want to make a deal, I think that person won't be around very long. That person will not be listened to very long. Because I believe that Russia wants to make a deal. I believe, certainly, the people of Ukraine want to make a deal. They've suffered more than anybody else. We talk about suffering - they've suffered.\n\nBut if you think about it, under President Bush, they got Georgia, right? Russia got Georgia. Under President Obama, they got a nice, big submarine base, a nice big chunk of land where they have their submarines. You know that, right? Crimea. Under President Trump, they got nothing. And under President O-Biden, they tried to get the whole thing. They tried to get the whole big Ukraine, the whole thing. If I didn't get in here, they would've gotten the whole thing.\n\nSo, I can only say - you can go back to Bush, you go back to Obama, and go back to Biden - they took a lot. The only one they didn't get - you know what I gave them? I gave them anti-tank missiles. That's what I gave them. I gave them sanctions on Russia - on Russia. I gave them Javelins. You know the Javelins? You know when they took out all those tanks?\n\nYou know, the tanks were heading to Kyiv by the hundreds, and they were unstoppable, and I gave them Javelins.\n\nSo, you know, I really - Putin is the one that will tell you this has not been so good for them. The fact is that I just want fairness. I want fairness.\n\nBut think of it. I gave Russia nothing except grief. I gave them nothing. I gave them sanctions and Javelins. That's what I gave them.\n\nObama gave them sheets. And you heard that statement before. It's a very famous - Trump gave them Javelins, and Obama gave them sheets. And then they say how close I am to Russia.\n\nLet me tell you, we have to make a deal, because there are a lot of people being killed that shouldn't be killed. But remember, Trump gave them nothing, and the other presidents gave them a lot. They gave them everything.\n\nQ Mr. President, on trade. You met with president - Argentine President Javier Milei at CPAC. He wants to sign a free trade agreement -\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Right.\n\nQ - with the United States. Is that something that you would consider, even with Argentina, or any other country?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I'll consider anything. And Argentina - I think he's great, by the way. I think he's a great leader. He's doing a great job. He's doing a fantastic job. Brought it back from oblivion.\n\nYeah, we'll look at things. We're looking at the UK with things. It doesn't have to be tariffs. But tariffs are easy, they're fast, they're efficient, and they bring fairness.\n\nFor instance, when people kill their dollar, their equivalent of the dollar, whatever - whether it's the yuan or the yen in Japan or the yuan in China - when they drop them down, that gives us - that puts us at a very unfair disadvantage. So, all I have to do is say, Howard, we're going to have to raise the tariffs a little bit.\n\nBecause I've called President Xi, I've called the leaders of Japan to say, You can't continue to reduce and break down your currency. You can't do it, because it's unfair to us. It's very hard for us to make tractors - Caterpillar - here, when Japan, China, and other places are killing their currency, meaning driving it down.\n\nSo, all of these things add up, and the way you solve it very easily is with tariffs. Because when they do that, instead of having to make phone calls every day, like I used to do with certain leaders - President Xi, a little bit - a lot of phone calls talking about the fact that they're lowering their yuan. They're lowering it down. And that makes it very, very hard for us.\n\nSo, this way, I just say, Look, let them do that, and we make up for it with the tariffs. But -\n\nQ Will you be speaking with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum about tariffs today?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yeah, sure, I will. I have a lot of respect for her. I have a lot of respect for her.\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nQ After the 10 percent tariff take ef- -\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yeah.\n\nQ - takes effect, it'll be 20 percent on China now. How high are you willing to go against China?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I can't say. It depends on what they do with their currency. It depends on what they do in terms of a retaliation with some kind of an economic retaliation, which I don't think they're going to retaliate too much.\n\nHey, look, the United States has been taken advantage of for 40 years. The United States has been a laughing stock for years and years. That's why this gentleman has built in Taiwan, instead of building here. It would have been better if he built here.\n\nIf we had a president that knew what they were doing - and we had a lot of them very bad on trade. Look, I'm a huge fan of Ronald Reagan, but he was bad on trade. Very bad on trade. He allowed a lot of people, a lot of businesses, to be taken. So, I say that with due respect, because I - he was so great on other things, but he was bad on trade.\n\nWe are setting records right now - records like nobody has ever seen before. When you have companies like this coming in and almost 40 percent of their company, in one signature, is going to be devoted to what he does, which is one of the most important - important businesses in the world, that's an unbelievable thing. When Apple now is going to start building all of their plants here, all because of what we've done in terms of - it's not because he likes me or they like me. They don't probably like me at all. I don't know. I think he likes me a little bit, at least. (Laughter.)\n\nMR. WEI: No, I like you.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: But you know what? It's the incentive we've created or the negative incentive. I mean, it's going to be very costly for people to take advantage of this country. They can't come in and steal our money and steal our jobs and take our factories and take our businesses and expect not to be punished, and they're being punished by tariffs.\n\nIt's a very powerful weapon that politicians haven't used because they were either dishonest, stupid, or paid off in some other form. And now we're using them.\n\nQ Have you spoken with President Xi?\n\nQ Agriculture -\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Say it.\n\nQ Have you spoken with President Xi about this this term?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I don't want to tell you that.\n\nQ On those incentives, sir.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much, everybody.\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nThank you. Thank you very much.\n\nSource: The White House, the United States"

This will give the Company the flexibility to capitalize on future customer demand for Silicon Anode or other gases while minimizing near-term operational costs.\n\nThis announcement follows the Company's decision to shut down polysilicon production at its Butte, Montana facility in February 2024. Once the shutdown process at the Moses Lake facility is complete, REC Silicon will have completely discontinued the production of polysilicon at both facilities. Moving forward, REC Silicon will focus its business efforts on silicon gases where the Company has clear strength, market positioning, and product differentiation. The Company is prioritizing driving costs out of its silicon gas assets and optimizing production, with a goal to return to profitability.\n\nProduction Issues at the Moses Lake Facility The shutdown of the Moses Lake facility follows numerous, previously disclosed efforts to improve the level of some key impurities that resulted primarily from the post-reactor product finishing and handling systems. Initiatives included changing contact materials, procedures, operating conditions and parameters, passivation measures and bypassing equipment; and bringing in third-party resources to assist in evaluating and mitigating the situation. However, the Company was unsuccessful in its attempts to fully rectify the issues and ultimately received an unsuccessful qualification test, as announced on December 17, 2024.\n\nDecember 17, 2024: REC Silicon Results of Qualification Test\n\nREC Silicon ASA (\"REC Silicon\" or the \"Company\") has now received the results from the qualification test for its ultra-high purity polysilicon from the recently restarted silane-based high-purity granular production facility in Moses Lake, Washington. The Company was notified yesterday by its customer of the results from the qualification test that was completed earlier this month through a third-party testing partner. Unfortunately, due to the impurity issues in the qualification material sent, the customer deemed the test to be unsuccessful. This was due to lower-than-expected levels of crystallization and the ingot yield observed in the testing runs, which the customer deemed not to be acceptable for their production process at this stage. The Company is in discussions with its customer to determine the feasibility of another test which will be contingent upon the Company making improvements in the manufacturing process at Moses Lake. The timing and likelihood of achieving the necessary improvements is uncertain at this point in time. As a result of the unsuccessful qualification test, REC Silicon is reviewing multiple strategic options. This may include additional operational adjustments, contractual re-negotiations, and other mitigative actions. REC Silicon continues to work on additional financing to ensure the Company's financial flexibility. The Company will provide additional operational and financing details when such information becomes available.\n\nSource: Oslo Bors\n\nCreated by www.buysellsignals.com [http:\/\/www.buysellsignals.com]"

        "Story":"TSMC to Invest $100 Billion in U.S. Chip Manufacturing, Expanding Arizona OperationsMar 05, 2025\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM, Financials) is committing $100 billion to expand its chip manufacturing operations in the United States, bringing its total U.S. investment to $165 billion.\n\nWith continuous changes in the global supply chain, the business intends to build five more semiconductor manufacturing plants in Arizona, hence enhancing local production capability.\n\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump greeted the revelation as a \"tremendous move by the most powerful company in the world.\" Drawing on a recent AI infrastructure initiative combining Oracle, OpenAI, and SoftBank, he connected the investment to attempts to establish the United States as a leader in artificial intelligence.\n\nThe U.S. government's larger drive to guarantee local semiconductor manufacturing corresponds with TSMC's growth. Trump has attacked Taiwan for \"stealing\" U.S. chip production and pushed for taxes on semiconductor imports, thereby underlining the company's involvement in the worldwide supply chain.\n\nThe newest investment made by the chipmaker comes from a previous pledge of $12 billion in 2020 to establish a facility in Arizona, then raised to $65 billion for a third factory. To help with growth, the U.S. Commerce Department has given a $6.6 billion subsidy.\n\nKey suppliers of both Nvidia (NVDA, Financials)\u200b and Apple (AAPL, Financials), TSMC is also very important in the artificial intelligence sector. A Nvidia spokesman said the firm will \"fully utilize TSMC's global manufacturing network\" to improve supply chain resilience.\n\nWith initiatives to lower reliance on foreign supply chains still driving investment in local production, the expansion emphasizes the strategic relevance of semiconductor manufacture to the U.S. economy and national security.\n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

        "Headline":"Trump calls for an end to the Chips Act, redirecting funds to national debt",
        "Story":"Trump calls for an end to the Chips Act, redirecting funds to national debtMar 05, 2025\n\nWhy it matters:Donald Trump wants to kill off the Chips Act, the 2022 bipartisan law that is handing out $52.7 billion in subsidies to help bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US. The President wants to use the money to pay the national debt instead.\n\nIn his first address to the joint session of Congress since he returned as President, Trump blasted the Chips Act.\n\n\"Your Chips Act is a horrible, horrible thing. We give hundreds of billions of dollars and it doesn't mean a thing. They take our money and they don't spend it,\" Trump said.\n\n\"You should get rid of the Chips Act and whatever is left over, Mr. Speaker, you should use it to reduce debt.\"\n\nAccording to the Treasury Department, the US federal debt is over $36.2 trillion, 123% of the country's 2024 national income.\n\nTrump suggested that manufacturing companies would be incentivized to build facilities in the US to avoid the new tariffs he has introduced. \"We don't have to give them money,\" Trump said.\n\nYesterday, chip giant TSMC announced that it was increasing its investment in US chip manufacturing by an extra $100 billion, bringing the total to $165 billion. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Trump's tariffs have made the US a more attractive proposition when overseas firms are looking for locations to build manufacturing facilities.\n\nTSMC's $6.6 billion grant awarded under the US Chips Act was finalized last November. Lutnick said the government was not planning on giving TSMC any new subsidies, despite it being eligible for a 25% manufacturing investment tax credit. The company said last month that it has already received $1.5 billion of the award.\n\nSo far, the Chips act has announced approximately $32.5 billion in grant awards and up to $5.5 billion in loans to 32 companies across 48 projects in 23 states. In addition to TSMC, the biggest beneficiaries have been Intel ($8.5 billion), Samsung ($6.4 billion), Micron ($6.1 billion), and GlobalFoundries ($1.5 billion).\n\nSome in government have expressed concerns about Trump's plans, including New York Governor Kathy Hochul, who said the Chips act \"is the reason Micron is bringing $100 billion and 50,000 jobs to Central New York. Trump just said he wants to get rid of it.\"\n\nRepresentative Greg Stanton said Trump's words were a \"direct attack on Arizona's semiconductor industry and tens of thousands of Arizona workers.\"\n\nReuters reported this week that approximately one-third of staff in the US Commerce Department office overseeing the allocation of Chips act money were laid off.\n\nThe Chips (Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors) and Science Act was enacted in August 2022 with the aim of boosting domestic semiconductor manufacturing, research, and development. It was a response to the global chip crisis that hit during the pandemic, as well as China's persistent threat to Taiwan, which produces about 90% of the world's most advanced semiconductors\n\nThe $52.7 billion the act is funding to support the semiconductor industry comes in the form of $39 billion in manufacturing incentives, including grants and loans, and $13.2 billion for research and development.\n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

        "Headline":"Taiwan's TSMC investment in US makes political rather than economic sense, says analyst",
        "Story":"Taiwan's TSMC investment in US makes political rather than economic sense, says analystTSMC's newly-announced US investment plans do not make sense economically but have a strong political rationale, according to a Heritage Foundation research fellow.\n\nFaced with US President Donald Trump's tariff threats, TSMC \"is trying to do all it can to signal its commitment to the US and counter the narrative that its dominance in chip manufacturing harms US interests,' according to Michael Cunningham, a researcher at the DC-based think tank. He said TSMC and Taiwan are trying to demonstrate to Trump officials and the American people that they are actively contributing to the US, per CNA.\n\nTSMC announced on Monday that it would invest another NT$3.29 trillion (US$100 billion) to build five more facilities in the US. Trump said TSMC would avoid tariffs through its investment.\n\nTSMC did not provide a timeline for the new investments. Kuo Ming-Chi an analyst with TF International Securities, said that while TSMC's investment appears substantial, 'the lack of details provides flexibility for spending based on future conditions.'\n\nCunningham said Trump's term may end before the new investments produce chips, so it is unclear how the news will impact possible tariffs unless an agreement was made prior.\n\nIn addition, Thomas Shattuck, a program manager at the University of Pennsylvania's Perry World House, said that TSMC's announcement was expected. He emphasized two ways Taiwan could minimize the impact after Trump took office: a huge arms package request and more investment from TMSC.\n\nHowever, Shattuck said he did not see a link between TSMC's new investments and whether Trump would defend Taiwan if China attacked.\n\nEconomics Minister Kuo Jyh-huei did not answer when asked if he thought TSMC's announcement was related to Trump's threats to place tariffs on semiconductors. He said that TSMC's plan to invest in the US does not mean the company will become American."

        "Story":"TSMC's NT$3.29 trillion investment in US would only account for 5-7% of outputDespite the large amount of TSMC's newly announced US investment, an analyst said it would only comprise a small percentage of its production.\n\nKuo Ming-Chi an analyst with TF International Securities, said on Tuesday that TSMC's NT$3.29 trillion (US$100 billion) plan to build five more facilities in the US was a 'win-win negotiation,' per Medium. Kuo said that while TSMC's investment appears substantial, 'the lack of details provides the flexibility for spending based on future conditions.'\n\nHe said the investment's ambiguity should soften the impact on TSMC's profitability. He said that TSMC's greatest challenge remains market demand and its ability to maintain its lead in advanced process technology.\n\nKuo estimated that TSMC's US fabs will have an average gross margin of around 30% to 35%. Once fully operational, these fabs are expected to reduce TSMC's overall gross margin by 1.5% to 2%.\n\nTo mitigate this negative impact, TSMC will further push its supply chain for cost reductions, Kuo said. While this will put considerable pressure on existing suppliers, it will also create opportunities for new suppliers.\n\nIn April 2024, TSMC announced plans to build a third fab in Arizona to produce 2nm chips, raising investments in the US to US$65 billion. On Monday, TSMC CEO C.C. Wei said the firm will build three more chip fabs, two advanced packaging facilities, and an RandD center in Arizona, bringing total US investments to US$165 billion.\n\nAccording to Kuo, even if TSMC completes all planned advanced-node fabs in the US, they will still account for only about 5% to 7% of the firm's global capacity. Kuo predicted that US customers will remain highly dependent on TSMC's production capacity in Taiwan 'for years.'\n\nIn addition, Kuo said the successful operation of TSMC's US fabs in the coming years will still rely heavily on remote technical support from TSMC's teams in Taiwan."

        "Headline":"TSMC To Invest $100 Bn In US Chip Manufacturing Expansion",
        "Story":"TSMC To Invest $100 Bn In US Chip Manufacturing ExpansionTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has announced a fresh USD 100 billion investment in the United States to establish five additional semiconductor facilities in the coming years. The announcement was made by TSMC CEO C.C. Wei alongside former US President Donald Trump at the White House. This expansion aims to strengthen US chip manufacturing and reduce reliance on Asian supply chains.\n\nThe investment will fund three new chip fabrication plants, two advanced packaging facilities and a research and development center, reinforcing TSMC's role in the US semiconductor industry. The move follows TSMC's previous expansion plan in April 2024, where it increased its US investment to USD 65 billion and announced a third Arizona factory by 2030.\n\nTrump, emphasising national security concerns, highlighted the importance of domestic semiconductor production, stating, \"We must be able to build the chips and semiconductors that we need right here.\" The investment is expected to generate 40,000 construction jobs over the next four years.\n\nTSMC, a key supplier to US tech giants such as Nvidia, Qualcomm and AMD, faces challenges in managing higher production costs in the US compared to its Taiwan operations. The company's shares dropped by 2 per cent following the announcement, with analysts citing cost concerns.\n\nAdditionally, reports indicate that Trump administration officials held discussions with Wei in New York regarding a potential joint venture in Intel's factory unit. The deal could involve several chip firms taking stakes in Intel's operations, though Intel has not publicly commented on the matter.\n\nThe investment aligns with broader efforts by global firms to strengthen US technological infrastructure. In February, Apple committed to a USD 500 billion investment over four years and SoftBank, along with Emirati billionaire Hussain Sajwani, pledged multi-billion dollar contributions.\n\nTaiwan's government will review the investment in accordance with its regulations on large overseas expansions. Presidential office spokesperson Karen Kuo stated that while TSMC's expansion in the US is welcomed, Taiwan will ensure its most advanced semiconductor processes remain on the island.\n\nThe new facilities' technological specifications remain undisclosed, but TSMC had previously committed to manufacturing 2-nanometer chips at its second Arizona plant by 2028 and using its advanced 'A16' technology in the state.\n\nTSMC's US expansion was initially driven by the Trump administration's push to localise semiconductor production, culminating in the CHIPS and Science Act under President Joe Biden, which allocated USD 52.7 billion in subsidies. In 2023, the US Commerce Department finalised a USD 6.6 billion subsidy for TSMC's Arizona operations, with the new USD 100 billion investment also qualifying for tax credits under the 2022 law.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested that semiconductor firms are investing in the US to navigate new tariffs imposed by Trump. Meanwhile, the Biden administration previously secured commitments from all five global leading-edge semiconductor firms to establish US facilities, addressing security risks associated with imported chips.\n\nWhile Taiwan remains a dominant player in global chip production, rising geopolitical tensions with China continue to influence TSMC's expansion strategy. China claims Taiwan as part of its territory, a claim that Taiwan's government firmly rejects.\n\nCopyright 2025 BW Businessworld Media Pvt Ltd, distributed by Contify.com"

        "Story":"What TSMC's $100 Bn Investment In The US Means For TaiwanTaiwanese chip-making giant TSMC plans to invest a whopping $100 billion in the United States, after US President Donald Trump threatened to slap tariffs on overseas-made chips. Taiwanese chip-making giant TSMC plans to invest a whopping $100 billion in the United States, after US President Donald Trump threatened to slap tariffs on overseas-made chips.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is the world's biggest maker of the critical technology that has become the lifeblood of the global economy.\n\nThis week's announcement takes the total amount TSMC has pledged to invest in the United States to $165 billion, which the company says is the \"largest single foreign direct investment in US history\".\n\nIt follows Trump's accusations that Taiwan stole the US chip industry and his threats to impose tariffs of up to 100 percent -- and Taipei's promises to invest more in the United States.\n\nAFP looks at what TSMC's investment could mean for Taiwan.\n\nSemiconductor chips are used in everything from smartphones and televisions to electric vehicles and missiles -- and more than half of them are made in Taiwan.\n\nThe concentration of chip manufacturing on the island has long been seen as a \"silicon shield\" protecting it from an invasion or blockade by China -- and an incentive for the United States to defend it.\n\nChina has upped military pressure on Taiwan in recent years to press its claim of sovereignty over the self-ruled island, where TSMC has its headquarters and the bulk of its fabrication plants.\n\nThat has fuelled calls for the firm to move more of its production off the island to avoid supply disruptions if China did attack.\n\nTrump recently warned of import levies of 25 percent, or higher, on overseas-made chips, which one analyst has said could trigger a recession in the industry.\n\nWhile TSMC's latest investment might deflect the threat of tariffs, there are fears it could hurt Taiwan's economy and weaken its \"silicon shield\".\n\n\"The more TSMC produces in the United States, the less important Taiwan will be in geopolitics and the less incentives the United States will have to help Taiwan in the future,\" said Ko Ju-chun, a lawmaker with the main opposition Kuomintang party.\n\nTaiwan's leaders are aware of the risks as they try to stay onside with their most important security backer Washington and protect the island's status as a chip-making powerhouse.\n\nPresident Lai Ching-te's office said Tuesday the government would review TSMC's deal \"in accordance with the law\" and ensure that the \"most advanced\" chip-making processes stayed in Taiwan.\n\nTSMC had already pledged to invest more than $65 billion in three factories in the US state of Arizona, one of which began production in late 2024.\n\nThe $100 billion investment will be used to expand its US footprint further, with three new fabrication plants, two advanced packaging facilities and a research and development team centre.\n\nRichard Hu, deputy director of the Taiwan Center for Security Studies think tank, said Trump wanted to prevent TSMC from falling into China's hands and to make it a \"technological asset of the United States\".\n\n\"Trump's ultimate goal is to ensure that the US can fully or critically control TSMC's semiconductor production, making it a de facto part of America's chip industry,\" Hu said.\n\nTaipei security analyst Su Tzu-yun was more optimistic, telling AFP that TSMC's investment would make Taiwan \"safer\" and help grow the chip industry.\n\nIt would also build trust between Taipei and Washington, and ease Trump's concerns about US economic security, said Su, from the Institute for National Defense and Security Research.\n\n\"I think the importance of Taiwan is not only TSMC but also the geostrategy,\" Su said, noting the importance of global shipping lanes near Taiwan.\n\nHowever, James Yifan Chen of Tamkang University said higher manufacturing costs in the United States would drive up prices of products using TSMC chips.\n\nAnd there were no guarantees the investment would make the mercurial Trump more inclined to defend Taiwan.\n\n\"The deal's effect on US willingness to defend Taiwan is unclear,\" said Wen-Ti Sung, a nonresident fellow with the Atlantic Council's Global China Hub.\n\n\"It really depends on how Trump feels on any particular day, and whether Beijing will attempt to outbid Taiwan subsequently.\"\n\nThe views expressed in content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex et al.

        "Story":"World's largest chipmaker TSMC to invest 100 billion USD in US04 Mar 2025 (VOV5) Following a meeting with President Donald Trump at the White House on Monday, TSMC's CEO C. C. Wei said the money will be used to build advanced chip fabrication facilities in the next four years.\n\nPresident Trump said, 'This 100 billion USD in new investment will go to build five cutting-edge fabrication facilities in Arizona, and will create thousands of high-paying jobs and boost America's dominance in artificial intelligence.'\n\n'Semiconductors are the backbone of the 21st century economy, powering everything from AI to automobiles to advanced manufacturing. And we must be able to build the chips and semiconductors that we need right here, in American factories, with American skill and American labor,' Trump noted.\n\nTSM's investment fits the US's long-term goal of reviving its domestic semiconductor industry, which has seen a shift to Asian countries in recent years."

        "Story":"(LEAD) Trump says TSMC will invest US$100 bln to build advanced chip manufacturing facilities in U.S.04 Mar 2025 (Yonhap News Agency) U.S. President Donald Trump said Monday Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) will invest US$100 billion to build advanced chip producing facilities in the United States, as he is seeking to use tariffs to bolster domestic manufacturing.\n\nThe announcement came after Trump accused Taiwan last month of taking U.S. chip businesses away, arguing that those businesses should come back to America. During his confirmation hearing in January, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also claimed that TSMC \"leveraged\" the U.S. and took chip businesses from the U.S.\n\n\"Today, Taiwan Semiconductor is announcing that they will be investing at least $100 billion in new capital in the U.S. over the next short period of time to build state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing facilities,\" he said after a meeting with TSMC CEO C.C. Wei at the White House. \"I think mostly, it's going to be in Arizona, which is a great state.\"\n\nThe $100 billion investment plan is in addition to the Taiwanese tech titan's current $65 billion investment in Arizona, the TSMC CEO said. It is to be used to build five cutting-edge fabrication facilities in the Grand Canyon State.\n\n\"Most importantly, actually, we are going to produce AI chips. We are going to produce many chips to support AI progress,\" the TSMC CEO said.\n\nIn November, the Commerce Department under the preceding Biden administration announced it finalized a $6.6 billion government subsidy for TSMC's U.S. unit for chip production in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nTSMC's investment move is likely to be keenly watched by South Korean chipmakers, Samsung Electronics Co. and SK hynix, as Trump has been using tariffs as a key policy tool to boost domestic manufacturing and pare down America's trade deficits.\n\nLate last year, the Commerce Department said it awarded Samsung Electronics up to $4.7 billion in direct funding to support the South Korean tech giant's chipmaking investment in central Texas, and give up to $458 million in direct funding and up to $500 million in loans to SK hynix for its investment in Indiana."

Analysts at Goldman Sachs noted that while TSMC's further investment in the U.S. was expected, it addresses two main objectives: reducing production concentration risks\u2014currently, 95% of its capacity is in Taiwan\u2014and meeting the increasing demand from American clients.\n\nThis strategic decision aligns with U.S. government policies aimed at boosting domestic chip manufacturing capabilities. Despite the increased investment, TSMC maintains its long-term gross margin guidance at \"53% or above.\" Meanwhile, former President Trump has controversially stated that the U.S. should repeal the current administration's chip legislation, which provides funding to chip manufacturers.\n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

        "Headline":"Trump says TSMC will invest $100 bil. to build advanced chip manufacturing facilities in US",
        "Story":"Trump says TSMC will invest $100 bil. to build advanced chip manufacturing facilities in USU.S. President Donald Trump said Monday Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) will invest $100 billion to build advanced chip producing facilities in the United States, as he is seeking to use tariffs to bolster domestic manufacturing.\n\nThe announcement came after Trump accused Taiwan last month of taking U.S. chip businesses away, arguing that those businesses should come back to America. During his confirmation hearing in January, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also claimed that TSMC \"leveraged\" the U.S. and took chip businesses from the U.S.\n\n\"Today, Taiwan Semiconductor is announcing that they will be investing at least $100 billion in new capital in the U.S. over the next short period of time to build state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing facilities,\" he said after a meeting with TSMC CEO C.C. Wei at the White House. \"I think mostly, it's going to be in Arizona, which is a great state.\"\n\nThe $100 billion investment plan is in addition to the Taiwanese tech titan's current $65 billion investment in Arizona, the TSMC CEO said. It is to be used to build five cutting-edge fabrication facilities in the Grand Canyon State.\n\n\"Most importantly, actually, we are going to produce AI chips. We are going to produce many chips to support AI progress,\" the TSMC CEO said.\n\nIn November, the Commerce Department under the preceding Biden administration announced it finalized a $6.6 billion government subsidy for TSMC's U.S. unit for chip production in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nTSMC's investment move is likely to be keenly watched by South Korean chipmakers, Samsung Electronics Co. and SK hynix, as Trump has been using tariffs as a key policy tool to boost domestic manufacturing and pare down America's trade deficits.\n\nLate last year, the Commerce Department said it awarded Samsung Electronics up to $4.7 billion in direct funding to support the South Korean tech giant's chipmaking investment in central Texas, and give up to $458 million in direct funding and up to $500 million in loans to SK hynix for its investment in Indiana."

But in a statement, the company told PCMag: \u201cIt is extremely difficult to develop new advanced manufacturing processes and then enter volume production.\u201d\n\n\u201cInitial deployment of a new process technology requires close collaboration between R&D and production, and new processes will likely be deployed in Taiwan first to ensure they can be successfully ramped up,\u201d TSMC added.\u00a0\n\nThe company issued the statement after Taiwan\u2019s government said it would ensure that TSMC keeps \u201cits most advanced manufacturing processes in Taiwan,\u201d according to The Guardian .\u00a0\n\nIn the US, TSMC has already started producing chips using its 4-nanometer process at its first fab in Arizona, which kicked off volume production in Q4. However, the company\u2019s most advanced chip technology at the 3nm and the upcoming 2nm node is being used and developed in factories in Taiwan.\u00a0\n\nAlthough Taiwan might get first dibs, TSMC indicated to PCMag it\u2019s still committed to bringing its most advanced chip nodes to the US, citing its customers, which include Apple, AMD, Nvidia, Qualcomm and even Intel.\u201cWe plan to deploy new processes in the US in a strategic manner that narrows the gap following initial launch, aligning with customer needs and product schedules,\u201d the chip manufacturing giant added.\u00a0\n\nBecause TSMC is based in Taiwan, there\u2019s been growing concern that the company\u2019s chip technologies could fall into the hands of China should it ever invade the island. During Monday\u2019s event announcing the TSMC investment, Trump himself weighed in on the threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.\n\nTrump: Intel Was Great Until 'Taiwan Took Our Chip Business Away'Best Buy: Brace for Price Increases From Trump's TariffsIntel's $28 Billion Ohio Factory Delayed Again, Won't Open Until 2030\n\nRecommended by Our Editors\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say \u2018minimize,\u2019\u201d Trump said when asked whether TSMC\u2019s investment would cushion the threat of China possibly trying to take Taiwan.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat would be a catastrophic event, obviously,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it will at least give us a position where we have \u2014 in this very, very important business, we would have a very big part of it (the chip manufacturing) in the United States.\u201d\n\nTSMC also made the investment when Trump has been threatening to impose tariffs on foreign-made chips. According to Wired , the White House hasn\u2019t shut the door on such tariffs, despite TSMC\u2019s plan to create more manufacturing in the country.\n\nAbout Michael Kan\n\nSenior Reporter\n\nI've been working as a journalist for over 15 years\u2014I got my start as a schools and cities reporter in Kansas City and joined PCMag in 2017.\n\nRead Michael's full bio\n\nRead the latest from Michael Kan\n\n * 'It's Gone': Ontario Rips Up Starlink Contract to Hit Back at Trump's Tariffs\n * Nvidia: Sorry, Founders Edition GeForce RTX 5070 Won't Arrive on Launch Day\n * Best Buy: Brace for Price Increases From Trump's Tariffs\n * Apple Upgrades iPad Air With M3 Chip, Boosts Base iPad Storage\n * SpaceX's Texas Starlink Factory Produces 15,000 Dishes Per Day\n * More from Michael Kan\n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

        "Story":"Taiwan economic minister says TSMC will not become AmericanEconomics Minister Kuo Jyh-huei said that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s plan to invest NT$3.294 trillion (US$100 billion) in the US does not mean the company will become American.\n\n'In the long run, I think the investment may not be enough to attract the entire supply chain to go,' Kuo told reporters outside the legislature on Tuesday. He said suggestions that TSMC may become 'USSMC' were uncalled for, per CNA.\n\nKuo was responding to questions about TSMC CEO C.C. Wei'sMonday investment announcement with US President Donald Trump at the White House. Wei said the investment will go toward three more fabs, two advanced packaging facilities, and an RandD center in Arizona.\n\nKuo said the investment would not decrease Taiwan's value to the world and noted that TSMC has many customers other than those in the US. 'The whole world relies on chips produced by Taiwan,' he said.\n\nKuo did not directly answer when asked if he thought the announcement was related to Trump's threat to place tariffs on imports of Taiwan's semiconductors. He said all companies will consider their markets, the resources of an investment destination, and the global layout when making investment decisions.\n\nKuo said the economics ministry had some knowledge of the investment before it was announced. He did not say what the ministry was informed of."

        "Story":"Taiwan's Taroko Corporation expands into US marketTaroko Corporation will open its first location in Katy, Texas in mid-March, with two additional locations set for Phoenix, Arizona, near TSMC's new fabs.\n\nAt a media event on Tuesday, the company, known for indoor batting cages and bowling alleys, said it is expanding into Los Angeles and other US cities. Taroko spokesperson Hsu Chun-chi said the company has committed to opening six or seven new locations in the US this year, per UDN.\n\nHsu said the company expects the utilization rate at US facilities to be comparable to Taiwan, though rent is approximately double and labor costs are four times as expensive. Hsu said the latter would be offset by automated equipment, with each US location expected to have higher profit margins than Taiwan.\n\nIn addition to the US market, Taroko has invested in a Japanese subsidiary with a capital of NT$44 million (US$1.4 million). Hsu said the company will target Japanese shopping malls to set up baseball-themed leisure facilities, and it has contacted owners of existing batting cages for leasing.\n\nTaroko said there are few Japanese batting cage chains, creating market opportunities for the company. There is no particular timetable for expansion into Japan.\n\nTaroko operates 10 baseball and softball batting cages, three bowling alleys, nine game centers, three roller skating rinks, and two spas across Taiwan. The company said the sales performance of batting cages is due to the popularity of baseball in Taiwan.\n\nAfter Taiwan won the Premier 12 championship in November, Taroko experienced 30% year-on-year growth.\n\nThe company said it would distribute souvenirs to shareholders via an app before a shareholders' meeting on May 26. The company increased its shareholders to over 190,000 in 2024."

        "Story":"TSMC equipment suppliers up despite Taiwan stock market downturnThe Taiwan stock market opened lower and fluctuated throughout Tuesday in response to US tariffs and domestic manufacturing data.\n\nThe Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index, or TAIEX, closed down 159.37 points at 22,596.88. Turnover totaled NT$400.9 billion (US$12.18 billion), per CNA and CTEE.\n\nThe three major weighted stocks showed mixed performances, with TSMC ending the session down NT$20 (61 cents) at NT$1,000. Foxconn gained NT$0.5 to close at NT$170.5, while MediaTek rose NT$35 to close at NT$1,505.\n\nTSMC's drop followed a statement from CEO C.C. Wei early Tuesday, where he announced a US$100 billion investment in the US, including the construction of five new facilities and a research center. The news impacted the market, contributing to the stock's decline.\n\nTSMC-related equipment stocks\n\nIn contrast to TSMC's struggles, shares of TSMC-related equipment companies rose following the news. Trusval Technology, Marketech International, and Allied Supreme hit the daily limit-up.\n\nOther related companies, including United Integrated Services, Taiwan Specialty Chemicals, and WinWay, saw gains between 6% and 9%. Companies like Solar Applied Materials Technology, Scientech, and Nova Technology also posted increases of over 3%.\n\nFositek leads bearing sector rally\n\nFositek, the leading bearing stock in Taiwan, reported a record-breaking annual profit of NT$17.9 per share for 2024, marking a new record high. By reducing friction and managing stress, bearings enable smooth rotational or linear movement in mechanical systems.\n\nBearings are crucial in high-speed rotations and heavy loads, like those in automobiles. They reduce friction between mechanical parts, enhancing vehicle performance and reliability. Bearings are also integral in medical imaging devices, surgical robots, and artificial joints, where they ensure precise motion control and smooth operation for safety and accuracy.\n\nGiven the significant heat output of AI servers, liquid cooling solutions are widely adopted to manage thermal performance effectively.\n\nFositek's stock hit its daily price limit, closing at NT$732. The positive sentiment also boosted other bearing-related stocks, with companies like Shin Zu Shing, Jarllytec, and Syncmold Enterprise all seeing gains, making bearing stocks one of the strongest sectors in the Taiwan stock market on Tuesday.\n\nUS bond ETFs rise amid risk aversion\n\nUS Treasury bond prices surged as global risk aversion rose, with several US bond ETFs experiencing significant volume increases. ETFs such as the Capital Ice ESG 20+ Year BBB Corporate ETF, Cathay US Treasury 20+ Year Bond ETF, and Yuanta US Treasury 20+ Year Bond ETF all saw trading volumes over 100,000 shares.\n\nDespite securing a NT$510 million contract with Taipower, Acmepoint Energy Services' stock experienced extreme volatility. The stock hit its daily limit up before a sharp decline, resulting in a 6.27% loss at closing after an intraday swing exceeding 15%.\n\nGeopolitical tensions and tariff conflicts are gradually making raw materials a sought-after resource. Investors are eyeing the bulk shipping sector, which is poised to secure another wave of business opportunities.\n\nThe benchmark Baltic Dry Index rose by 47 points on Monday, strengthening the bulk shipping sector. Wisdom Marine Lines rose by over 8%, while U-Ming Marine Transport gained more than 5%.\n\nCathay Securities Investment Consulting Manager Tsai Ming-han noted that, despite the sharp declines in Wall Street, the Taiwan stock market has shown relatively strong performance. However, Tsai warned that the potential for further gains in Taiwan's market remains limited until the US tariff issues are fully resolved.\n\nWhile the tariffs on Canada and Mexico may not have the most direct effect on Taiwan, upcoming decisions on tariffs, including those on chips and reciprocal tariffs, are expected to have a larger impact. The chip tariffs are particularly concerning for Taiwan, while the reciprocal tariffs could have broader consequences for the global market."

WEI: Thank you, Mr. Welcoming, from TSMC-- which is the biggest there is, at a level that you can't even calculate, frankly-- C.C. Wei, to the White House for a very historic announcement. WASHINGTON, March 4 -- President Trump issued the following remarks on March 3, 2025:\n\nREMARKS BY PRESIDENT TRUMP ON INVESTMENT ANNOUNCEMENT\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Hello, everybody. Thank you very much.\n\nThank you very much. This is a very big day for a lot of reasons, but this gentleman is a very unique man. I think I can say, in the world of chips, certainly, but in the world pretty much of business, nobody has done what he's done. For those of you that are into that world, you would say, \"Wow, he's a legend.\" But he is a legend. And it's an honor to be with you. Very great honor. Thank you very much.\n\nMR. WEI: Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much.\n\nWelcoming, from TSMC -- which is the biggest there is, at a level that you can't even calculate, frankly -- C.C. Wei, to the White House for a very historic announcement. This is a tremendous thing for our country and, hopefully, for his company.\n\nWe're also pleased to be joined by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and White House AI and crypto czar, David Sacks, another two very highly respected people. It's great to have you guys involved. And, David, thank you very much for coming on.\n\nDavid is sort of the king of intellect in that world. We have some good people.\n\nToday, Taiwan Semiconductor is announcing that they will be investing at least $100 billion dollars in new capital in the United States over the next short period of time to build state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing facilities. I think, mostly, it's going to be in Arizona, which is what I understand, which is a great state. I like it because I won it. But I won most of them -- (laughs) -- actually. So -- but I did. We won it, and we won it big.\n\nThe most powerful AI chips in the world will be made right here in America, and it'll be a big percentage of the chips made by his company. But, as you know, they're based mostly in Taiwan. And they're far and away the biggest. There's nobody even close.\n\nThis $100 billion in new investment will go into building five cutting-edge fabrication facilities in the great state that we just discussed, Arizona, and will create thousands of jobs -- many thousands of jobs, and they're high-paying jobs.\n\nIn total, today's announcement brings Taiwan Semiconductor investments to about $165 billion -- they've started already -- among the largest new foreign direct investments in United States.\n\nApple, as you know, made a big announcement last week of $500 billion, and we have some others that have announced.\n\nWe have many that want to announce. But I don't have time to do all of these announcements, I tell you. But, for you, I'm doing the announcement.\n\nMR. WEI: Thank you.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: This will create hundreds of billions of dollars in economic activity and boost America's dominance in artificial intelligence and beyond.\n\nSemiconductors are the backbone of the 21st century economy -- and, really, without the semiconductors, there is no economy -- powering everything from AI to automobiles to advanced manufacturing. And we must be able to build the chips and semiconductors that we need right here, in American factories, with American skill and American labor. And that's exactly what we're doing.\n\nAs you know, Taiwan pretty much has a monopoly on that market. And I think \"pretty much\" is not a term that's even appropriate. They do have a monopoly. And this is a tremendous move by the most powerful company in the world.\n\nIt's a matter of economic security. It's also a matter of national security for us. And, at the same time, Mr. Wei will be able to diversify and have his tremendous presence in another place and a very safe place. And I want to thank Taiwan Semiconductor for doing the announcement.\n\nAnd I'd like to ask Mr. Wei to say a few words, if you might.\n\nAnd I'd also like to ask Howard and David -- you can say a couple of words. But maybe you should go first because, right now, he's the most important man in the room. I'm sorry, fellas.\n\nPlease.\n\nThank you very much. Thank you. Great honor.\n\nMR. WEI: Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you.\n\nMR. WEI: I'm a -- I'm a little bit nervous, so I have to pull out my piece of paper.\n\nMr. President, Secretary Lutnick -- and, David, I didn't know that -- your title, but -- okay.\n\nFirst, I want to thank -- say thank you to Mr. President to give me this opportunity to announce our big project in the U.S.\n\nTSMC is the world's largest chip manufacturing, founded by Dr. Morris Chang in 1987. It's now at the forefront of semiconductor technology, supporting AI advancement and industry growth.\n\nIn fact, I would like to wind back the time that in 2020 we have to thank President Trump's vision and his support. So, TSMC start the journey of establishing the advanced chip manufacturing in Arizona. And now, let me proudly say, now the vision become reality.\n\nIn Phoenix, Arizona, with 3,000 employees, we are producing the most advanced chip made on U.S. soil with the success of our first fab.\n\nSo, we are now very happy to announce we are going to invest additional 100 billion U.S. dollar in addition to our current 65-billion-U.S.-dollars investment in Arizona. We are going to build three more new fab -- be- -- after we promised the three fabs already, and another two very advanced packaging fab, and, most important, an R&D center, also in Arizona.\n\nFor this, all the investment -- $165 billion -- is going to create thousand of the high-paid job, as the president just announced. And we are, most important -- actually, we are going to produce many AI chips. We are going to produce many chips to support AI's progress and to support the smartphone's progress.\n\nAnd, again, with that, I want to thank President Trump again for his support. In addition, I also want to thank my customers in the U.S., such as Apple, Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm, Broadcom. They all support TSMC's manufacturing in the U.S. Without their support, we probably cannot make it true.\n\nSo, again, I want to thank them. Also, I'd like to thank the TSMC's employee. Without their effort, we just cannot make it today.\n\nThat's all I want to say. And thank you.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you. That's great. (Applause.) Thank you very much.\n\nHoward, please. David.\n\nSECRETARY LUTNICK: Sure.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you.\n\nSECRETARY LUTNICK: So, I'm thrilled to be here today, because President Trump has made it a fundamental objective to bring semiconductor chip manufacturing home to America.\n\nUnder the Biden administration, TSMC received a $6 billion grant, and that encouraged them to build $65 billion. So, America gave TSMC 10 percent of the money to build here. And now you're seeing the power of Donald Trump's presidency, because TSMC, the greatest manufacturer of chips in the world, is coming to America with $100 billion investment. And, of course, that is backed by the fact that they can come here because they can avoid paying tariffs.\n\nSo, the idea is: Come to America. Build greatness in America. Build for the American customers -- the Apple, Nvidia, that whole list that Chairman Wei gave -- in order to bring production to America.\n\nSo, we're really, really excited. This continues the most incredible path you've ever seen, in these first weeks and months of the Trump administration, of incredible manufacturing coming to America. The keys that the president has called out are coming here. They're coming here in huge size because they want to be in the greatest market in the world, and they want to avoid the tariffs that, if they're not here, they'd have to suffer.\n\nSo, I want to congratulate C.C. Wei for bringing in this incredible $100 billion investment, but it's on the shoulders of our president, Donald Trump, which is why he's coming.\n\nSo, thank you.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you.\n\nDavid.\n\nMR. SACKS: Thank you, sir. Well, the products that TSMC makes are literally the most important products in the world. I mean, these advanced chips power everything. They power AI. They power your phone. They power your cars. And without them, the whole modern economy would stop, but they're not made in the United States.\n\nSo, for TSMC to move here is a huge, huge development, and we owe that to President Trump's leadership on the economy and Secretary Lutnick as well. And, C.C., thank you for -- for coming here.\n\nThank you. Yeah.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you, David.\n\nSo, thank you very much. A big percentage of chips with this investment will be made now -- a big percentage. Worldwide, we had very little. Almost none. We used to have a lot with Intel. But we had very little. And we'll be at close to 40 percent of the market with this transaction and a couple of others that we're doing. That's a tremendous leap -- like, a leap that nobody would have really said was possible.\n\nSo, I just want to thank you all for being here. If you want a couple of questions.\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nQ: On the --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Ideally on this subject.\n\nYes, please.\n\nQ: -- specific number of jobs it will create. He said thousands --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: They -- yeah.\n\nQ: -- but do you have a better --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: They -- you're probably talking about 25,000 jobs. But it'll get bigger and bigger with time. Knowing this gentleman, it'll get bigger and bigger. There'll be no stopping him. (Laughs.)\n\nQ: Mr. President, what more --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Brian, go ahead.\n\nQ: Right. In addition to the jobs, you talked about national security, and that's one thing I think a lot of Americans --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yeah.\n\nQ: -- at home don't understand. Explain the national security aspect of this.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, without the chips and semiconductors, nothing runs today. You can't buy a car without them. You can't get a radio, a television, nothing -- you can't get anything. And we thought it was very important -- obviously, business was, but we thought even to terms of national security, to have this large percentage of the chips, semiconductors, and other things that they make -- the most important product, and not a product that you can really copy. It takes years and years.\n\nYou're on the needle of a pin is total genius. I mean, they can put things -- I mean, something the size of the needle, the point of a pin, they put information that is just not even believable.\n\nSo, if you would --\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nIf you would see this, it's just really something.\n\nYes, Brian.\n\nQ: Can I -- one -- one more aspect to that. Honda --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yeah.\n\nQ: -- announced they're coming to Indiana because of the tariffs. Once again --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: That's right.\n\nQ: -- you're bringing additional jobs in manufacturing. Do you want to comment on that as well?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, Honda is coming, and I told you about Apple, that they're going to be starting to build massively here -- $500 billion. And we have many other companies. It's going to be announced, but we had many that have already announced. And no, it's going to be great. It's looking -- it's looking really strong. I don't think this country has ever seen anything like we're seeing right now.\n\nNow, the tariffs, as you know, it will start a week earlier than the reciprocal, which is going to be on -- a couple of weeks earlier. Reciprocal tariffs start on April 2nd. And I wanted to make it April 1st, but I didn't want to do -- I didn't want to go April Fool's Day -- (laughter) -- because that cost me -- that costs a lot of money, but -- that one day. So, we're going April 2nd.\n\nBut very importantly, tomorrow, tariffs -- 25 percent on Canada and 25 percent on Mexico, and that'll start. So, they're going to have to have a tariff. So, what they'll have to do is build their car plants, frankly, and other things in the United States -- in which case, they have no tariffs. In other words, you build -- and this is exactly what Mr. Wei is doing by building here. Otherwise, they'll build -- if they did them in Taiwan to send them here, they'll have 25 percent or 30 percent or 50 percent or whatever the number may be someday. It'll go only up. But by doing it here, he has no tariffs, so he's way ahead of the game.\n\nAnd I would just say this to people in Canada or Mexico, if they're going to build car plants, the people that are doing them are much better off building here, because we have the market. We're the market where they sell the most.\n\nAnd so, I think it's going to be very exciting. Very exciting for the automobile companies. Very exciting for -- I can think of any -- as an example, North Carolina, they had the great -- I used to go there to buy furniture for hotels, and it's been wiped out. That business all went to other countries, and now it's all going to come back into North Carolina -- the furniture manufacturing business.\n\nPlease.\n\nQ: Mr. President --\n\nQ: Is the Ukraine minerals deal now dead, or can it be revived? What -- what's your --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I'll let you know. We're making a speech -- you probably heard about it -- tomorrow night, so I'll let you know tomorrow night.\n\nBut, no, I don't think so. I think it's -- look, it's a great deal for us, because, you know, Biden very, very, foolishly -- stupidly, frankly -- gave $300 billion and -- $350 billion, more accurately -- to a country to fight and to try and do things. And you know what happened? We get nothing. We get nothing -- just gave it.\n\nWe could have rebuilt our entire U.S. Navy with $350 billion. Think of it. Three hundred and fifty billion, we could have rebuilt our U.S. Navy.\n\nSo, he gave it away as fast as the money could be gone. And what we're doing is getting that all back and a lot more than that. And what we need -- it's very important for this business that we're talking about here, with chips and semiconductors and everything else -- we need rare earths. And the deal we have is we have the finest rare earths that you can.\n\nQ: Sir, on Ukraine. Sir, on Ukraine.\n\nQ: Are you going to press back --\n\nQ: Thank you, Mr. President. What do you need to see from President Zelenskyy to restart these negotiations?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I just think he should be more appreciative, because this country has stuck with them through thick and thin. We've given them much more than Europe, and Europe should have given more than us, because, as you know, that's right there. That's the border.\n\nThis country really was like the fence on the border. It was very important to Europe. And I'm not knocking Europe, I'm saying they're just -- they were a lot smarter than Joe Biden, because Joe Biden didn't have a clue. He just gave money hand over a fist, and they should have been able to equalize with us.\n\nIn other words, if we gave a dollar, they should have given. Well, we gave $350 billion. They probably gave 100, but on top of it all, they get their money back, because they are doing it in the form of a loan, and it's a secured loan.\n\nSo, when I saw that, which I've known about for a little while, I said, \"It's time for us to be smart.\" At the same time, it's great for them, because they get us in the country taking the rare earth, which is going to fuel this big engine, and especially the engine that we've, in a very short time, created. And we get something, and we're in the -- we're there. We have a presence there.\n\nWith all of that being said, I want one thing to happen: I want all of those young people to stop being killed. They're being killed by the thousands every single week. Last week, 2,700 were killed. Twenty-seven hundred young -- in this case, just about, all young boys from Ukraine and from Russia. And that's not young people from the United States, but it's on a human basis.\n\nI want to see it stop. The money is one thing, but the death. And they're losing thousands of soldiers a week, and that's not including the people that get killed every time a town goes down or a missile goes into a town.\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nWe -- and -- and I want to see it stop.\n\nYes.\n\nQ: Mr. President, are you considering canceling military aid to Ukraine? And can we get a reaction to what the Kremlin just said, that your administration is bringing U.S. worldview in alignment with Moscow's?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: So, this is a deal that should have never happened. This is a deal that would have never happened, and it didn't happen -- for four years, it didn't happen. It was never even close to happening. If I were president, would not have happened. And October 7th would have -- would not have happened in Israel. And inflation wouldn't have happened.\n\nAnd Afghanistan, disastrous -- the way they withdrew -- not the fact that they withdrew but the way they withdrew -- would have never happened. And we would have had Bagram right now instead of China having it. It was one hour away from where China makes their nuclear weapons. We would have kept Bagram -- one of the biggest air bases in the world.\n\nAll of these things happened, and it's a shame. But it is what it is, and now we're here. I want to see it end fast. I don't want to see this go on for years and years.\n\nNow, President Zelenskyy supposedly made a statement today in AP -- I'm not a big fan of AP, so maybe it was an incorrect statement -- but he said he thinks the war is going to go on for a long time, and he better not be right about that. That's all I'll say.\n\nQ: Mr. President, is there any --\n\nQ: Could this project -- could this minimize the impact of the U.S. with chips should China decide to isolate Taiwan or China decide to take Taiwan?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, it's a very interesting point. It's a great question, actually. But this would certainly -- I can't say \"minimize.\" That would be a catastrophic event, obviously. But it will at least give us a position where we have -- in this very, very important business, we would have a very big part of it in the United States. So, it would have a big impact if something should happen with Taiwan.\n\nQ: And with Russia sanctions, are you looking at relieving Russian sanctions if there is a peace deal?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, we're going to make deals with everybody to get this war, including Europe and European nations. And they've acted very well. You know, they're good people. I know; most of them are friends of mine -- the heads of state, the heads of the various countries, prime ministers from the different -- I got four prime ministers and five presidents called me over the last two days, and they want to work it out. They want to get it worked out.\n\nAnd I think they're also -- you know, they're talking money, but the money is less important than the deaths. We're talking thousands of young people a week. And people would say why do I care about Ukraine, young people; why do I care about -- and not all young, but they're pretty young. You know, Ukraine is running a little bit low, and they're getting older. They're recruiting older people. It's a very, very sad thing that's happening over there, and we want to get it finished. We want to stop the death.\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nQ: Mr. President, on the tariffs. Is there any room left for Canada and Mexico to make a deal before midnight? And should we expect those Chinese tariffs, the extra 10 percent to take effect tomorrow?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: No room left for Mexico or for Canada. No, the tariffs, you know, they're all set. They go into effect tomorrow.\n\nQ: Mr. President, just a follow-up on my colleague's question. Hearing --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: And just so you understand, vast amounts of fentanyl have poured into our country from Mexico and, as you know, also from China, where it goes to Mexico and goes to Canada. And China also had an additional 10, so it's 10 plus 10.\n\nAnd it comes in from Canada, and it comes in from Mexico, and that's a very important thing to say.\n\nYeah, please. Go ahead.\n\nQ: Have you decided if you're going to suspend military aid to Ukraine? Have you made that decision?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I haven't even talked about that right now. I mean, right now, we'll see what happens. A lot of things are happening right now, as we speak -- I mean, literally as we speak. I could give you an answer and go back to my office -- the beautiful Oval Office. I could go back into the Oval Office and find out that the answer is obsolete.\n\nIt's like his business. It's obsolete. You come up with a new chip, and it's obsolete about two minutes later, right? But that's what's good about his business. That's why he's the only one that's successful in it. But --\n\nQ: And on tariffs, sir.\n\nQ: Mr. President, just to follow up my colleague's question from Russia is saying that your foreign policy is largely in line with their vision. Should that be concerning to Americans?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Said what?\n\nQ: Should that be concerning to Americans?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Read the statement.\n\nQ: That Russia -- Russia says that your administration's foreign policy is, quote, \"largely in line\" with their vision.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I tell you what, I think it takes two to tango, and you're going to have to make a deal with Russia, and you're going to have to make a deal with Ukraine. You're going to have to have the ascent, and you're going to have to have the consent from the European nations, because I think that's important, and from us.\n\nI think everybody has to get into a room, so to speak, and we have to make a deal. And the deal could be made very fast. It should not be that hard a deal to make. It could be made very fast.\n\nNow, maybe somebody doesn't want to make a deal, and if somebody doesn't want to make a deal, I think that person won't be around very long. That person will not be listened to very long. Because I believe that Russia wants to make a deal. I believe, certainly, the people of Ukraine want to make a deal. They've suffered more than anybody else. We talk about suffering -- they've suffered.\n\nBut if you think about it, under President Bush, they got Georgia, right? Russia got Georgia. Under President Obama, they got a nice, big submarine base, a nice big chunk of land where they have their submarines. You know that, right? Crimea. Under President Trump, they got nothing. And under President O-Biden, they tried to get the whole thing. They tried to get the whole big Ukraine, the whole thing. If I didn't get in here, they would've gotten the whole thing.\n\nSo, I can only say -- you can go back to Bush, you go back to Obama, and go back to Biden -- they took a lot. The only one they didn't get -- you know what I gave them? I gave them anti-tank missiles. That's what I gave them. I gave them sanctions on Russia -- on Russia. I gave them Javelins. You know the Javelins? You know when they took out all those tanks?\n\nYou know, the tanks were heading to Kyiv by the hundreds, and they were unstoppable, and I gave them Javelins.\n\nSo, you know, I really -- Putin is the one that will tell you this has not been so good for them. The fact is that I just want fairness. I want fairness.\n\nBut think of it. I gave Russia nothing except grief. I gave them nothing. I gave them sanctions and Javelins. That's what I gave them.\n\nObama gave them sheets. And you heard that statement before. It's a very famous -- Trump gave them Javelins, and Obama gave them sheets. And then they say how close I am to Russia.\n\nLet me tell you, we have to make a deal, because there are a lot of people being killed that shouldn't be killed. But remember, Trump gave them nothing, and the other presidents gave them a lot. They gave them everything.\n\nQ: Mr. President, on trade. You met with president -- Argentine President Javier Milei at CPAC. He wants to sign a free trade agreement --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Right.\n\nQ: -- with the United States. Is that something that you would consider, even with Argentina, or any other country?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I'll consider anything. And Argentina -- I think he's great, by the way. I think he's a great leader. He's doing a great job. He's doing a fantastic job. Brought it back from oblivion.\n\nYeah, we'll look at things. We're looking at the UK with things. It doesn't have to be tariffs. But tariffs are easy, they're fast, they're efficient, and they bring fairness.\n\nFor instance, when people kill their dollar, their equivalent of the dollar, whatever -- whether it's the yuan or the yen in Japan or the yuan in China -- when they drop them down, that gives us -- that puts us at a very unfair disadvantage. So, all I have to do is say, \"Howard, we're going to have to raise the tariffs a little bit.\"\n\nBecause I've called President Xi, I've called the leaders of Japan to say, \"You can't continue to reduce and break down your currency. You can't do it, because it's unfair to us.\" It's very hard for us to make tractors -- Caterpillar -- here, when Japan, China, and other places are killing their currency, meaning driving it down.\n\nSo, all of these things add up, and the way you solve it very easily is with tariffs. Because when they do that, instead of having to make phone calls every day, like I used to do with certain leaders -- President Xi, a little bit -- a lot of phone calls talking about the fact that they're lowering their yuan. They're lowering it down. And that makes it very, very hard for us.\n\nSo, this way, I just say, \"Look, let them do that, and we make up for it with the tariffs.\" But --\n\nQ: Will you be speaking with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum about tariffs today?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yeah, sure, I will. I have a lot of respect for her. I have a lot of respect for her.\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nQ: After the 10 percent tariff take ef- --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yeah.\n\nQ: -- takes effect, it'll be 20 percent on China now. How high are you willing to go against China?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I can't say. It depends on what they do with their currency. It depends on what they do in terms of a retaliation with some kind of an economic retaliation, which I don't think they're going to retaliate too much.\n\nHey, look, the United States has been taken advantage of for 40 years. The United States has been a laughing stock for years and years. That's why this gentleman has built in Taiwan, instead of building here. It would have been better if he built here.\n\nIf we had a president that knew what they were doing -- and we had a lot of them very bad on trade. Look, I'm a huge fan of Ronald Reagan, but he was bad on trade. Very bad on trade. He allowed a lot of people, a lot of businesses, to be taken. So, I say that with due respect, because I -- he was so great on other things, but he was bad on trade.\n\nWe are setting records right now -- records like nobody has ever seen before. When you have companies like this coming in and almost 40 percent of their company, in one signature, is going to be devoted to what he does, which is one of the most important -- important businesses in the world, that's an unbelievable thing. When Apple now is going to start building all of their plants here, all because of what we've done in terms of -- it's not because he likes me or they like me. They don't probably like me at all. I don't know. I think he likes me a little bit, at least. (Laughter.)\n\nMR. WEI: No, I like you.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: But you know what? It's the incentive we've created or the negative incentive. I mean, it's going to be very costly for people to take advantage of this country. They can't come in and steal our money and steal our jobs and take our factories and take our businesses and expect not to be punished, and they're being punished by tariffs.\n\nIt's a very powerful weapon that politicians haven't used because they were either dishonest, stupid, or paid off in some other form. And now we're using them.\n\nQ: Have you spoken with President Xi?\n\nQ: Agriculture --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Say it.\n\nQ: Have you spoken with President Xi about this this term?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I don't want to tell you that.\n\nQ: On those incentives, sir.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much, everybody.\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nThank you. Thank you very much.\n\n* * *\n\nOriginal text here: https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/remarks\/2025\/03\/remarks-by-president-trump-on-investment-announcement\/"

        "Story":"TSMC turning into USMC? Taiwan netizens criticize DPP for selling out the island as TSMC announces $100b investment in US\n Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) plans to make a fresh $100 billion investment in the US including the construction of five additional chip facilities in the country in coming years, its CEO announced with US President Donald Trump on Monday, sparking backlash in the island of Taiwan, with critics claiming TSMC \"has become USMC,\" calling the move \"yet another example of the Democratic Progress Party (DPP) selling out Taiwan.\" \n\n TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker and a leading supplier to major US hardware manufacturers, announced the plan during a meeting between CEO C.C. Wei and Trump at the White House, Reuters reported on Tuesday. \"We must be able to build the chips and semiconductors that we need right here,\" Trump said. \"It's a matter of national security for us.\" \n\n The company said the expansion includes plans for three new chip fabrication plants, two advanced packaging facilities and a major R&D center, without specifying a timeline for these projects, per the report. \n\n Building on the company's ongoing $65 billion investment in its advanced semiconductor manufacturing operations in Phoenix, Arizona, TSMC's total investment in the US is expected to reach US$165 billion, according to a company statement released on Tuesday. \n\n The Global Times noticed that as of press time, almost all of the comments under the report by Taiwan media China Times were critical of the move. One said, \"The Americans didn't even pay a cent, yet TSMC rushed over. Seems like it's changing its name into 'USMC', and Lai Ching-te is even bowing in gratitude to Trump.\" Another referred to the move as yet another example of the DPP selling out Taiwan. \n\n According to Reuters, the TSMC shares opened down 2.25 percent on Tuesday after it made the announcement. \n\n As concerns rise over TSMC turning into a US-owned enterprise, Zhu Fenglian, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said on February 26 that the DPP authorities, in pursuit of their own interests, have been yielding to external forces, using Taiwan's semiconductor industry and leading enterprises as bargaining chips in their attempt to seek independence by relying on foreign support. \n\n They have even treated the enterprises as \"gifts\" to hand over, repeatedly selling out the interests and well-being of the people and businesses in the island. \"This shameless act of betraying Taiwan while taking pride in ingratiating themselves with the US has faced growing opposition from more and more local residents and businesses,\" the spokesperson said. \n\n \"The Taiwan chipmaker's development trajectory and investment direction suggest it's highly likely that TSMC will be gradually dismantled and absorbed by the US,\" said Zhu Songling, a professor from the Institute of Taiwan Studies of Beijing Union University. \n\n Zhu Songling noted that the $100 billion investment is largely catering to American interests rather than its own strategic needs. \"At the core of this strategy lies America's ambition for technological dominance, trying to gain control over key chip manufacturers and reduce reliance on the Asian supply chain,\" he told the Global Times on Tuesday. \n\n Zhu Songling said TSMC's decision will accelerate the industrial hollowing-out of the island, greatly impacting its economy. As one of the island's main economic pillars and a crucial part of the global supply chain, Taiwan's semiconductor industry will lose its strategic significance if TSMC's advanced manufacturing is placed under US control. \n\n Losing TSMC will also undermine Taiwan's international strategic value. The US previously provided security assurances based on the island's semiconductor importance, but now American support may significantly decline, Zhu Songling noted, adding that as the trend for national reunification becomes increasingly clear, if the DPP keeps stubbornly refusing to recognize reality, they will face very unfavorable outcomes in the future. \n\n\nCopyright Global Times.

        "Story":"Trump Announces $165 Billion Semiconductor Investment Deal with TSMCTDT | Manama\n\nEmail: mail@newsofbahrain.com\n\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump announced a $165 billion investment deal with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) on Monday, March 3, at the White House. The deal is expected to bolster the U.S. semiconductor industry, create thousands of jobs, and enhance the country's technological standing.\n\n\"The most powerful AI chips in the world will be made right here in America,\" Trump stated during the announcement.\n\nTSMC, one of the world's largest chip manufacturers, is a key supplier for major companies including Intel, Apple, and Nvidia. The agreement aims to strengthen U.S. influence in the semiconductor sector while also reinforcing national security.\n\nExpansion Plans in Arizona\n\nAlthough TSMC primarily operates overseas, it has an existing presence in Arizona. Trump confirmed that TSMC's CEO plans to expand operations in the state, with construction set to begin on five state-of-the-art factories dedicated to producing advanced AI chips.\n\n\"Semiconductors are the backbone of the 21st-century economy, and really, without semiconductors, there is no economy,\" Trump added.\n\nTariffs Influence Business Decisions\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick explained that while the initial investment discussions began under the Biden administration, Trump's tariffs have played a crucial role in making the U.S. a more attractive location for companies like TSMC.\n\n\"They want to be in the greatest market in the world, and they want to avoid the tariffs. If they are not here, they have to suffer,\" Lutnick stated.\n\nFederal Workforce Reduction\n\nDespite the substantial investment in semiconductor manufacturing, Bloomberg reports that the U.S. Chips Program Office, established under the 2022 Chips Act to support domestic semiconductor production, is undergoing downsizing. The office, which employed 140 personnel under the Biden administration, is expected to see a 40% reduction in staff as part of Trump's broader federal workforce reduction efforts.\n\nThe announcement comes just days after Apple revealed its own $500 billion investment to expand U.S. facilities over the next four years, underscoring a broader trend of increased domestic technology investment.\n\nThe TSMC deal is set to significantly impact the U.S. semiconductor landscape, boosting innovation and strengthening the nation's position in global technology markets.\n\n\u00a9 2022 News of Bahrain Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

        "Story":"Will TSMC escape tariffs with pledge for $100B in U.S. chip manufacturing plants?Mar 04, 2025\n\nIt\u2019s been a whirlwind of news on the tariff front and Taiwan has avoided tariffs for now. But the timing of a $100 billion commitment by TSMC to build chip manufacturing plants in the U.S. may have helped.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is the biggest chipmaker in the world, but most of its chips are made in Taiwan. Donald Trump announced in a press event on Monday that TSMC would invest at least $100 billion in chip manufacturing plants in the U.S. acroos the next four years.\n\nTSMC is already building new factories in Arizona based on a prior $65 billion pledge, and now the extra cash will fund the construction of more factories in Arizona, said C. C. Wei, chairman and CEO of TSMC, during the briefing. All of it will support the production of AI chips, he said.\n\n\u201cI think it already helped Taiwan avoid tariffs. I have no doubt that there was a political influence in that decision,\u201d said Jim McGregor, a chip analyst at Tirias Research, in a message to GamesBeat.\n\nTSMC has also received $6.6 billion in grants from the Chips and Science Act, a bipartisan agreement reached during the Biden administration to boost domestic semiconductor production. Now TSMC is planning to invest $165 billion in chip factories in the U.S.\n\nBut the big question is how many jobs it can create. TSMC has had to bring a lot of its engineers over from Taiwan to get the new chips up to speed in terms of quality. The U.S. was the birthplace of the semiconductor industry, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily have the engineering talent anymore as so much production has moved offshore.\n\n\u201cI believe that\u00a0TSMC\u00a0was faced with 50-100% tariffs and had to make a choice between that and making increased US investments,\u201d said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. \u201cWhile I don\u2019t think the tariffs will be zero, they will be much lower, and I also don\u2019t think that\u00a0TSMC\u00a0will spend as much incrementally as is implied.\u00a0\u201c\n\nThe new investment brings TSMC\u2019s total investments in the U.S. chip industry to around $165 billion, Trump said. Intel has also received more than $2 billion via the Chips and Science Act and it has pledged to invest heavily in U.S. manufacturing. But Intel has had a hard time in recent years being competitive with TSMC.\n\nTrump had threatened to bring tariffs against Taiwan earlier, but he held back when he announced tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. Apple has also said it will invest more than $500 billion in U.S. manufacturing for its products.\n\nTSMC did not give a timeframe for the newly announced investments, but it said it would add 40,000 construction jobs over the next four years. Companies like Nvidia, AMD and Qualcomm are among TSMC\u2019s big customers.\n\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Dailyvb_dailyroundup 87a3e5037d\/river-fullSubscribe Now\n\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

Our core SRAM sales are strengthening as customer orders rebound due to normalized inventory levels and increasing demand from a key customer whose systems are integral to manufacturing leading AI chips. We anticipate this customer to become our largest revenue contributor in fiscal 2025.\"\n\nMr. Shu concluded, \"The development of our APU technology is progressing steadily. The Gemini-II chip is on track for a February tape-out with availability in May, aligning with a milestone with the Space Development Agency SBIR. The latest version of Gemini-II takes AI to the next level by combining advanced neural networks with cutting-edge radar imaging technology, like Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), designed to tackle important challenges in defense and aerospace. We can leverage Gemini-IIs architecture to accelerate the development of Plato, our next-generation chip, with a cost-effective, faster-to-market strategy. Platos ultra-low-power design will target rapidly growing markets for edge AI and large language model solutions. Additionally, increased operational efficiency and SRAM sales improvement position us for stability as we continue to evaluate strategic alternatives.\"\n\nCommenting on the outlook for GSI's fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, Mr. Shu stated, \"Our current expectations for the upcoming fourth quarter is for net revenues in a range of $5.4 million to $6.2 million, with gross margin of approximately 55% to 57%.\"\n\nThird Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Summary Financials\n\nThe Company reported net revenues of $5.4 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to $5.3 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and $4.6 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nPress Release article 2 of 18, Source: West Corporation, 301 words\n\nJanuary 17: GSI Technology Selected for U.S. Army SBIR Contract to Advance Edge AI Computing\n\nInnovative Compute-in-Memory Technology Promises Breakthrough in Military AI Capabilities\n\nSUNNYVALE, Calif., Jan. 17, 2025 -- GSI Technology, Inc.(Nasdaq: GSIT), the inventor of the Associative Processing Unit (APU), a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance compute (HPC) processing providing true compute-in-memory technology, today announced it has been selected by the U.S. Army for a potential contract award of up to $250,000 under the DoD Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program.

Existing customers are depleting their channel inventory, and we anticipate they will resume ordering in the upcoming quarters. Furthermore, we expect a significant increase in orders from an existing customer over the next 12 months. This opportunity for additional orders involves collaborating on a cutting-edge product for a leading AI chip developer, which is expected to drive consistent demand for this customer's equipment and our SRAM chips going forward.\n\nMr. Shu continued, Looking at our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we reported revenue of $4.6 million, which aligns with the midpoint of our guidance. Our gross margin was affected by product mix and severance costs associated with workforce reductions. In the second quarter, we implemented strategic cost-cutting measures expected to yield annual savings of $3.5 million. These initiatives include workforce reductions across all departments and enhanced operational efficiencies. As a result, we anticipate a significant decrease in cash burn, which, when combined with an improved revenue outlook, is expected to extend our financial runway.\n\nMr. Shu concluded, We are on track to meet our deadlines for the Gemini-II benchmarking project and remain committed to fulfilling our SBIR contract with the U.S. Air Force Labs by December 31, 2024, followed by the delivery of the software algorithm in the first quarter of calendar 2025.\n\nCommenting on the outlook for GSI's third quarter of fiscal 2025, Mr.\n\nPress Release article 7 of 18, Source: West Corporation, 214 words\n\nOctober 10 2024: GSI Technology to Announce Fiscal Second Quarter 2025 Results on October 24, 2024\n\nGSI Technology, Inc.

We are making excellent progress with our second generation of the APU, Gemini-II, and are extremely encouraged by the chip's results in testing, which has verified that instructions can be successfully executed through the embedded processor and that the data path is also working. Once we receive the second spin of Gemini-II this fall, we intend to initiate benchmarking that will allow us to begin preliminary customer sampling and engage with target customers before the calendar year-end.\n\nThe second generation of our APU brings significant performance enhancements, with more processing power and memory density, and suitable for both low power data center expansion and enabling data center functions at the edge, continued Mr. Shu. These capabilities empower local execution of computationally intensive tasks, increasing edge application capabilities. Additionally, Gemini-IIs memory can hold an entire small database, a potential door-opener for enhanced performance in image recognition applications. These small model sizes use algorithms with low precision model weight size to lower memory storage requirements and simplify computations, which the APU architecture is better suited for than traditional GPU architectures.\n\nPress Release article 14 of 18, Source: West Corporation, 71 words\n\nMay 02 2024: GSI Technology, Inc.

(Nasdaq: GSIT), the inventor of the Associative Processing Unit (APU), a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance compute (HPC) processing providing true compute-in-memory technology, today announced the release in production of two high capacity, low power server products. The Leda-E and Leda-S boards incorporate the Gemini-I APU, capable of 1.2 POPs at 80W and 800 TOPs at 40W, respectively. The new server offerings are available as a single 2U server of eight Leda-E boards at 10 POPs, and a 1U server of sixteen Leda-S boards, totaling 13 POPs.\n\nGSI's true compute-in-memory technology has proven differentiated capabilities in large (billion item) database search and high-performancecomputeapplications, such as facial recognition, drug discovery, Opensearch, and object detection and re-identification. The low 1.2kW full server power of these formidable systems unlocks the potential for the 1U server to be used in mobile or remote applications.\n\nSingle card versions of the Gemini-I have shown six-fold performance improvement over the Xeon CPU for seed location filtering in DNA read mapping by Cornell University1. Similarly, the Gemini-I has shown equivalent performance to the A100 for cryptography applications, such as high throughput hash-based security protocols, as demonstrated by Northern Arizona University (NAU)2. NAU found that an 8-card APU server would be compelling for further evaluation due to its smaller form factor in a 2U server compared to an equivalent A100 GPU system.\n\nServer systems based on GSIs production Gemini-I APU chip come pre-bundled with an application development compiler and can be further customized with Real-Time Fast Back Projection software or Fast Vector Search support.\n\nSystems are shipping from stock.\n\nPress Release article 17 of 18, 281 words\n\nMarch 31 2024: GSI Technology: File SEC Form 10-K - Management's Discussion and Analysis 10-K\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Our initial associative processing unit (\"APU\") products are focused on applications using similarity search, but have not resulted in material revenues to date. Similarity search is used in visual search queries for ecommerce, computer vision, drug discovery, cybersecurity and service markets such as NoSQL, Elasticsearch, and OpenSearch. We have solutions to accelerate multimodal vector search as an on-prem or SaaS solution for OpenSearch and general Fast Vector Search, and for processing large area SAR images in real-time at high resolution. We also design, develop and market static random access memories, or SRAMs (our current primary revenue source), that operate at speeds of less than 10 nanoseconds, which we refer to as Very Fast SRAMs, primarily for the networking and telecommunications and the military\/defense and aerospace markets. We are subject to the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, which has experienced significant fluctuations, often in connection with fluctuations in demand for the products in which semiconductor devices are used. Our revenues have been substantially impacted by significant fluctuations in sales to our largest customer, Nokia. We expect that future direct and indirect sales to Nokia will continue to fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. The networking and telecommunications market has accounted for a significant portion of our net revenues in the past and has declined during the past several years and is expected to continue to decline. In anticipation of the decline of the networking and telecommunications market, we have been using the revenue generated by the sales of high-speed synchronous SRAM products to finance the development of our new in-place associative computing solutions and the marketing and sale of new types of SRAM products such as radiation-hardened and radiation-tolerant SRAMs.\n\nOur revenues in recent years were impacted by changes in customer buying patterns and communication limitations related to COVID-19 restrictions that required a significant number of our customer contacts to work from home. While the COVID-19 pandemic has ended, worldwide inflationary pressures, higher interest rates and decline in the global economic environment have had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and financial condition. Furthermore, the easing of supply chain shortages and prior buffer stock purchases from significant customers led to a decrease in revenues in the second half of fiscal 2023 and during fiscal 2024.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $14.4 million, with no debt. We have a team in-place with tremendous depth and breadth of experience and knowledge, with a legacy business that is providing an ongoing source of funding for the development of new product lines. Our balance sheet and liquidity position has been strengthened by the recent sale of our Sunnyvale, California property, which we anticipate will provide further financial flexibility and security in the current environment of economic uncertainty. Generally, our primary source of liquidity is cash equivalents. Our level of cash equivalents has historically been sufficient to meet our current and\n\nlonger term operating and capital needs. We believe that during the next 12 months, continued inflationary pressures and higher interest rates will continue to negatively impact general economic activity and demand in our end markets. Although it is difficult to estimate the length or gravity of the continued inflationary pressures and higher interest rates, the evolving conflict in the Middle East and the decline in the global economic environment, are expected to have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, including potential impairments, and liquidity into fiscal 2025.\n\nRevenues. Substantially all of our revenues are derived from sales of our Very Fast SRAM products. Sales to networking and telecommunications OEMs accounted for 32% to 49% of our net revenues during our last three fiscal years. We also sell our products to OEMs that manufacture products for military and aerospace applications such as radar and guidance systems and satellites, for test and measurement applications such as high-speed testers, for automotive applications such as smart cruise control, and for medical applications such as ultrasound and CAT scan equipment.\n\nAs is typical in the semiconductor industry, the selling prices of our products generally decline over the life of the product. Our ability to increase net revenues, therefore, is dependent upon our ability to increase unit sales volumes of existing products and to introduce and sell new products with higher average selling prices in quantities sufficient to compensate for the anticipated declines in selling prices of our more mature products. Although we expect the average selling prices of individual products to decline over time, we believe that, over the next several quarters, our overall average selling prices will increase due to a continuing shift in product mix to a higher percentage of higher price, higher density products, and to a lesser extent, recent price increases to our customers due to supply constraints. Our ability to increase unit sales volumes is dependent primarily upon increases in customer demand but, particularly in periods of increasing demand, can also be affected by our ability to increase production through the availability of increased wafer fabrication capacity from TSMC, our wafer supplier, and our ability to increase the number of good integrated circuit die produced from each wafer through die size reductions and yield enhancement activities.\n\nWe may experience fluctuations in quarterly net revenues for a number of reasons. Historically, orders on hand at the beginning of each quarter are insufficient to meet our revenue objectives for that quarter and are generally cancelable up to 30 days prior to scheduled delivery. Accordingly, we depend on obtaining and shipping orders in the same quarter to achieve our revenue objectives. In addition, the timing of product releases, purchase orders and product availability could result in significant product shipments at the end of a quarter. Failure to ship these products by the end of the quarter may adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, our customers may delay scheduled delivery dates and\/or cancel orders within specified timeframes without significant penalty.\n\nWe sell our products through our direct sales force, international and domestic sales representatives and distributors. Our revenues have been and are expected to continue to be impacted by changes in customer buying patterns and communication limitations related to changes in working habits that have resulted in a significant number of our customer contacts working from home. Our customer contracts, which may be in the form of purchase orders, contracts or purchase agreements, contain performance obligations for delivery of agreed upon products. Delivery of all performance obligations contained within a contract with a customer typically occurs at the same time (or within the same accounting period). Transfer of control occurs at the time of shipment, title and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, and we have a right to payment. Thus, we will recognize revenue upon shipment of the product for direct sales and sales to our distributors.\n\nHistorically, a small number of OEM customers have accounted for a substantial portion of our net revenues, and we expect that significant customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future. Many of our OEMs use contract manufacturers to manufacture their equipment. Accordingly, a significant percentage of our net revenues is derived from sales to these contract manufacturers. In addition, a significant portion of our sales are\n\nmade to foreign and domestic distributors who resell our products to OEMs, as well as their contract manufacturers. Direct sales to contract manufacturers accounted for 20.5%, 19.8% and 31.0% of our net revenues for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Sales to foreign and domestic distributors accounted for 76.4%, 77.5% and 66.8% of our net revenues for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The following direct customers accounted for 10% or more of our net revenues in one or more of the following periods:\n\nNokia was our largest customer in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022. Nokia purchases products directly from us and through contract manufacturers and distributors. Based on information provided to us by its contract manufacturers and our distributors, purchases by Nokia represented approximately 21%, 17% and 29% of our net revenues in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our revenues have been substantially impacted by significant fluctuations in sales to Nokia, and we expect that future direct and indirect sales to Nokia will continue to fluctuate substantially on a quarterly basis and that such fluctuations may significantly affect our operating results in future periods. To our knowledge, none of our other OEM customers accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues in fiscal 2024, 2023 or 2022.\n\nCost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues consists primarily of wafer fabrication costs, wafer sort, assembly, test and burn-in expenses, the amortized cost of production mask sets, stock-based compensation and the cost of materials and overhead from operations. All of our wafer manufacturing and assembly operations, and a significant portion of our wafer sort testing operations, are outsourced. Accordingly, most of our cost of revenues consists of payments to TSMC and independent assembly and test houses. Because we do not have long-term, fixed-price supply contracts, our wafer fabrication, assembly and other outsourced manufacturing costs are subject to the cyclical fluctuations in demand for semiconductors. We have experienced increased costs as a result of supply chain constraints for wafers and outsourced assembly, burn-in and test operations. We review our manufacturing costs on a regular basis and pass on any cost increases to our customers when it makes sense to do so. Cost of revenues also includes expenses related to supply chain management, quality assurance, and final product testing and documentation control activities conducted at our headquarters in Sunnyvale, California and our branch operations in Taiwan.\n\nGross Profit. Our gross profit margins vary among our products and are generally greater on our radiation hardened and radiation tolerant SRAMs, on our higher density products and, within a particular density, greater on our higher speed and industrial temperature products. We expect that our overall gross margins will fluctuate from period to period as a result of shifts in product mix, changes in average selling prices and our ability to control our cost of revenues, including costs associated with outsourced wafer fabrication and product assembly and testing.\n\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for design engineers and other technical personnel, the cost of developing prototypes, stock-based compensation and fees paid to consultants. We charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred. We charge mask costs used in production to cost of revenues over a 12-month period. However, we charge costs related to pre-production mask sets, which are not used in production, to research and development expenses at the time they are incurred. These charges often arise as we transition to new process technologies and, accordingly,\n\ncan cause research and development expenses to fluctuate on a quarterly basis. We incurred charges of $2.4 million for a pre-production mask set for our APU2 during the quarter ended December 31, 2023. We believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to our long-term success, and we expect to continue to devote significant resources to product development activities. In particular, we are devoting substantial resources to the development of our in-place associative computing products. Accordingly, we expect that our research and development expenses will continue to be substantial in future periods and may lead to operating losses in some periods. Such expenses as a percentage of net revenues may fluctuate from period to period.\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of commissions paid to independent sales representatives, salaries, stock-based compensation and related expenses for personnel engaged in sales, marketing, administrative, finance and human resources activities, professional fees, costs associated with the promotion of our products and other corporate expenses. We expect that our sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods if we are able to grow and expand our sales force but that, to the extent our revenues increase in future periods, these expenses will generally decline as a percentage of net revenues. We also expect that, in support of any future growth that we are able to achieve, general and administrative expenses will generally increase in absolute dollars.\n\nAcquisition:\n\nOn November 23, 2015, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of privately held MikaMonu Group Ltd. (\"MikaMonu\"), a development-stage, Israel-based company that specialized in in-place associative computing for markets including big data, computer vision and cyber security. MikaMonu, located in Tel Aviv, held 12 United States patents and had a number of pending patent applications.\n\nThe acquisition was undertaken in order to gain access to the MikaMonu patents and the potential markets, and new customer base in those markets, that can be served by new products that we are developing using the in-place associative computing technology.\n\nThe acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase under authoritative guidance for business combinations. The purchase price of the acquisition was allocated to the intangible assets acquired, with the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired recorded as goodwill. We perform a goodwill impairment test near the end of each fiscal year and if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on an interim basis.\n\nThe acquisition agreement provides for potential \"earnout\" payments to the former MikaMonu shareholders in cash or shares of our common stock, at our discretion, during a period of up to ten years following the closing if certain revenue targets for products based on the MikaMonu technology are achieved. Earnout payments, up to a maximum of $30.0 million, equal to 5% of net revenues from the sale of qualifying products in excess of certain thresholds, will be made quarterly through December 31, 2025. As of March 31, 2024, none of the revenue targets have been achieved and no revenue based earnout payments have been paid to the former MikaMonu shareholders.\n\nThe maximum amount of the remaining potential earnout payments totals approximately $30.0 million at March 31, 2024. We determined that the fair value of this contingent consideration liability was $5.8 million at the acquisition date. The contingent consideration liability is included in contingent consideration, non-current on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at March 31, 2023 and 2024 in the amount of $1.1 million and $160,000, respectively\n\nAt each reporting period, the contingent consideration liability is re-measured at then current fair value with changes recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Changes in any of the inputs may result in significant adjustments to the recorded fair value. Re-measurement of the contingent consideration liability during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 resulted in a decrease of the contingent consideration liability of $0.9 million.\n\nThe allocation of the purchase price to acquired identifiable intangible assets and goodwill was based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The fair value allocated to patents was $3.5 million and the residual value allocated to goodwill was $8.0 million.\n\nResults of Operations Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2024 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2023\n\nNet Revenues. Net revenues decreased by 26.7% from $29.7 million in fiscal 2023 to $21.8 million in fiscal 2024. The overall average selling price of all units shipped in fiscal 2024 increased by 20.8% in fiscal 2024 compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease in net revenues is related to the current economic environment which has led to cautionary spending by our customers and purchases made as a result of supply chain constraints in the previous periods. Units shipped decreased by 39.3% in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. The networking and telecommunications markets represented 34% and 32% of shipments in fiscal 2024 and in fiscal 2023, respectively. Direct and indirect sales to Nokia, currently our largest customer, decreased by $500,000 from $5.0 million in fiscal 2023 to $4.5 million fiscal 2024. Shipments to Nokia will continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of demand and shipments to its end customers. While recent customer order patterns have been particularly variable, these fluctuations are related to economic and external factors, which include worldwide inflationary pressures, higher interest rates and the decline in the global economic environment. Shipments of our SigmaQuad product line accounted for 51.2% of total shipments in fiscal 2024 compared to 49.1% of total shipments in fiscal 2023\n\nCost of Revenues. Cost of revenues decreased by 17.2% from $12.0 million in fiscal 2023 to $9.9 million in fiscal 2024. Cost of revenues decreased as a result of the lower volume of units shipped in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 as discussed above. Cost of revenues included a provision for excess and obsolete inventories of $180,000 in fiscal 2024 compared to $226,000 in fiscal 2023. Cost of revenues included stock-based compensation expense of $228,000 and $202,000, respectively, in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023.\n\nGross Profit. Gross profit decreased by 33.1% from $17.7 million in fiscal 2023 to $11.8 million in fiscal 2024. Gross margin decreased from 59.6% in fiscal 2023 to 54.3% in fiscal 2024. The change in gross profit is primarily related to the change in net revenues discussed above. The decrease in gross margin was primarily related to change in the mix of products and customers and also reflects the impact of fixed overhead on lower shipment levels compared to the prior year. Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses decreased 7.9% from $23.6 million in fiscal 2023 to $21.7 million in fiscal 2024. The reduction in research and development spending in fiscal 2024 reflects the impact of cost reduction measures implemented in the quarter ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in research and development spending was primarily related to decreases of $2.2 million in payroll related expenses and $1.4 million in outside consulting expenses for the development of our APU-2 product. The decrease in research and development spending was partially offset by an increase in pre-production mask costs of $2.4 million related to our APU-2 product. Research and development expenses in fiscal 2024 were also offset by $435,000 of funding received under the Direct to Phase II award for the development of a Next-Generation Associative Processing Unit-2 for Enhanced Space-Based Capabilities. Research and development expenses included stock-based compensation expense of $1.4 million and $1.3 million in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively.\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 6.3% from $9.9 million in fiscal 2023 to $10.6 million in fiscal 2024. In fiscal 2024, the value of contingent consideration liability resulting from the MikaMonu acquisition decreased by $892,000 compared to a decrease of $1.7 million in fiscal 2023 as a result of re-measurement of contingent consideration liability in each year. Decreases of $554,000 in payroll related expenses and $196,000 in outside sales representative commissions were partially offset by increases of $284,000 in outside consultants and $234,000 in professional fees. Selling, general and administrative expenses included stock-based compensation expense of $1.2 million and $951,000 in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively.\n\nInterest Income and Other (Expense), Net. Interest income and other (expense), net increased from income of $202,000 in fiscal 2023 to income of $414,000 in fiscal 2024. Interest income increased by $232,000 due to higher interest rates received on cash and short-term investments. The foreign currency exchange loss increased from ($121,000) in fiscal 2023 to ($127,000) in fiscal 2024. The exchange loss in each period was primarily related to our Taiwan branch operations and operations in Israel.\n\nProvision (benefit) for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes decreased from $372,000 in fiscal 2023 to $70,000 in fiscal 2024. The provision for income taxes in fiscal 2024 included a benefit of ($117,000) related to the approval by the Israel tax authorities of a \"Preferred Company\" tax rate that was retroactively applied to fiscal 2023. Because we recorded a cumulative three-year loss on a U.S. tax basis for the year ended March 31, 2024 and the realization of our deferred tax assets is questionable, we recorded a tax provision reflecting a valuation allowance of $20.2 million in net deferred tax assets in fiscal 2024. Reductions in uncertain tax benefits due to lapses in the statute of limitations were not significant in the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nNet Loss. Net loss was ($16.0) million in fiscal 2023 compared to a net loss of ($20.1) million in fiscal 2024. This decrease was primarily due to the changes in net revenues, gross profit and operating expenses discussed above.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources:\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of $14.4 million compared to $30.6 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of March 31, 2023. Cash and cash equivalents totaling $9.4 million were held in foreign locations as of March 31, 2024.\n\nNet cash used in operating activities was $17.4 million and $16.8 million for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively. The primary uses of cash in fiscal 2024 were the net loss of $20.1 million and a decrease of $1.6 million in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The reduction in accrued expenses and other liabilities was primarily related to decreases in compensation related accruals, income taxes payable and deferred revenue. The uses of cash in fiscal 2024 were less than the net loss due to non-cash items including stock-based compensation of\n\n$2.8 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $927,000. The primary source of cash in fiscal 2024 was a decrease in inventories of $1.3 million.\n\nThe primary uses of cash in fiscal 2023 were the net loss of $16.0 million, a reduction in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $2.3 million and an increase in inventories of $2.0 million. The reduction in accrued expenses and other liabilities was primarily related to the payment of fiscal 2022 year-end accruals for incentive compensation. The uses of cash in fiscal 2023 were less than the net loss due to non-cash items including stock-based compensation of $2.5 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $1.0 million. The primary source of cash in fiscal 2023 was a decrease in accounts receivable of $1.1 million.\n\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $2.8 million and $6.7 million in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. Investment activities in fiscal 2024 primarily consisted of the maturity of certificates of deposit and agency bonds of $3.4 million partially offset by the purchase of property and equipment of $645,000. Investment activities in fiscal 2023 primarily consisted of the maturity of certificates of deposit and agency bonds of $7.0 million partially offset by the purchase of property and equipment of $316,000.\n\nCash provided by financing activities was $1.8 million and $402,000 in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively and consisted of the net proceeds from the sale of common stock pursuant to our employee stock plans.\n\nAt March 31, 2024, we had total minimum lease obligations of approximately $1.6 million from April 1, 2023 through April 30, 2027, under non-cancelable operating leases for our facilities.\n\nWhile higher interest rates, worldwide inflationary pressures and the decline in the global economic environment have created significant uncertainty as to general economic and capital market conditions for the remainder of calendar 2024 and beyond, we believe that our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents, and cash flow expected to be generated from our future operations and the net proceeds of approximately $11.2 million from the sale of our headquarters building in Sunnyvale, CA which closed on June 6, 2024 will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including revenue growth, if any, that we experience, any additional manufacturing cost increases resulting from supply constraints and the continuation of the impact of higher interest rates and inflation may have on our business, the extent to which we utilize subcontractors, the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain, the timing and extent of spending to support our product development efforts and the expansion of our sales and marketing team. Additional capital may also be required for the consummation of any acquisition of businesses, products or technologies that we may undertake. On June 28, 2023, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3, which was declared effective by the SEC on July 19, 2023. On August 1, 2023, we commenced a registered securities offering pursuant to a Sales Agreement (the \"Sales Agreement\") with Needham & Company, LLC (\"Needham\"). The Sales Agreement provides that we may offer and sell our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $25.0 million from time to time (the \"Offering\") through Needham, acting as our sales agent. We sold 133,000 shares pursuant to the offering at an average price of $4.20 for proceeds of $542,000, less offering costs of $389,000 during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. We cannot assure that additional equity or debt financing, if required, will be available on terms that are acceptable or at all.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had $2.2 million in purchase obligations for facility leases, wafers and software and test purchase obligations that are binding commitments, of which $1.2 million are payable in the next twelve months and $1.0 million are committed in the long term.\n\nIn connection with the acquisition of MikaMonu on November 23, 2015, we are required to make contingent consideration payments to the former MikaMonu shareholders conditioned upon the achievement of certain revenue\n\ntargets for products based on the MikaMonu technology. As of March 31, 2024, the accrual for potential payment of contingent consideration was $160,000.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates:\n\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\") requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates are inherent in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and include estimates affecting obsolete and excess inventory and contingent consideration. We believe that we consistently apply these judgments and estimates and that our financial statements and accompanying notes fairly represent our financial results for all periods presented. However, any errors in these judgments and estimates may have a material impact on our balance sheet and statement of operations. Critical accounting estimates, as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult and subjective judgments and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our critical accounting estimates include those regarding the valuation of inventories and contingent consideration.\n\nValuation of Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, cost being determined on a weighted average basis. Our inventory write-down allowance is established when conditions indicate that the selling price of our products could be less than cost due to physical deterioration, obsolescence based on changes in technology and demand, changes in price levels, or other causes. We consider the need to establish the allowance for excess inventory generally based on inventory levels in excess of 12 months of forecasted customer demand for each specific product, which is based on historical sales and expected future orders. At any point in time, some portion of our inventory is subject to the risk of being materially in excess of our projected demand. Additionally, our average selling prices could decline due to market or other conditions, which creates a risk that costs of manufacturing our inventory may not be recovered. These factors contribute to the risk that we may be required to record additional inventory write-downs in the future, which could be material. In addition, if actual market conditions are more favorable than expected, inventory previously written down may be sold to customers resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period.\n\nContingent Consideration. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability potentially payable in connection with our acquisition of MikaMonu was initially determined as of the acquisition date using unobservable inputs. These inputs included the estimated amount and timing of future revenue, the probability of achievement of the revenue forecast, and a risk-adjusted discount rate to adjust the probability-weighted cash flow payments to their present value. Since the acquisition date, at each reporting period, the contingent consideration liability is re-measured at its then current fair value with changes recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Due to revisions to the amount of expected revenue, the timing of revenue to be recognized prior to the end of the earnout period and the probability of achievement of the APU revenue forecast, the contingent consideration liability decreased by $892,000 from March 31, 2023 to March 31, 2024. Future changes to any of the inputs, including forecasted revenues from a new product, which are inherently difficult to estimate, or the valuation model selected, may result in material adjustments to the recorded fair value.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements:\n\nPlease refer to Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements appearing under Part II, Item 8 for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that may impact the Company.\n\nSECTION 4 BEARISH SIGNALS\n\n4.1 3-DAY: WEAK MOMENTUM DOWN\n\nGSIT declines 4.3% on miniscule volume 0.1 times average.

        "Story":"Patent Issued for Method of forming backside power rails (USPTO 12224324)2025 MAR 04-- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Technology Business Daily-- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. has been issued patent number 12224324, according to news reporting originating out of Alexandria, Virginia, by NewsRx editors. The patent' s inventors are Huang, Po-Yu, Lee, Chen-Ming, Wang, Mei-Yun, Wu, I-Wen, Yang, Fu-Kai. 2025 MAR 04 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Technology Business Daily -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (Hsinchu, Taiwan) has been issued patent number 12224324, according to news reporting originating out of Alexandria, Virginia, by NewsRx editors.\n\nThe patent's inventors are Huang, Po-Yu (Hsinchu, TW), Lee, Chen-Ming (Taoyuan County, TW), Wang, Mei-Yun (Hsin-Chu, TW), Wu, I-Wen (Hsinchu, TW), Yang, Fu-Kai (Hsinchu, TW).\n\nThis patent was filed on July 19, 2023 and was published online on February 11, 2025.\n\nFrom the background information supplied by the inventors, news correspondents obtained the following quote: \"The semiconductor integrated circuit (IC) industry has experienced exponential growth. Technological advances in IC materials and design have produced generations of ICs where each generation has smaller and more complex circuits than the previous generation. In the course of IC evolution, functional density (i.e., the number of interconnected devices per chip area) has generally increased while geometry size (i.e., the smallest component (or line) that can be created using a fabrication process) has decreased. This scaling down process generally provides benefits by increasing production efficiency and lowering associated costs. Such scaling down has also increased the complexity of processing and manufacturing ICs.\n\n\"For example, as integrated circuit (IC) technologies progress towards smaller technology nodes, multi-gate devices are introduced to improve gate control by increasing gate-channel coupling, reducing off-state current, and reducing short-channel effects (SCEs). A multi-gate device generally refers to a device having a gate structure, or portion thereof, disposed over more than one side of a channel region. Fin-like field effect transistors (FinFETs) and multi-bridge-channel (MBC) transistors are examples of multi-gate devices that have become popular and promising candidates for high performance and low leakage applications. A FinFET has an elevated channel wrapped by a gate on more than one side (for example, the gate wraps a top and sidewalls of a \"fin\" of semiconductor material extending from a substrate). An MBC transistor has a gate structure that can extend, partially or fully, around a channel region to provide access to the channel region on two or more sides. Because its gate structure surrounds the channel regions, an MBC transistor may also be referred to as a surrounding gate transistor (SGT) or a gate-all-around (GAA) transistor. The channel region of an MBC transistor may be formed from nanowires, nanosheets, other nanostructures, and\/or other suitable structures. The shapes of the channel region have also given an MBC transistor alternative names such as a nanosheet transistor or a nanowire transistor.\n\n\"As the dimensions of the multi-gate devices shrink, packing all contact features on one side of a substrate is becoming more and more challenging. To ease the packing density, it has been proposed to move some routing features, such as power lines (also referred to as power rails) to a backside of the substrate. While conventional backside power rail formation processes may be generally adequate for their intended purposes, they are not satisfactory in all aspects.\"\n\nSupplementing the background information on this patent, NewsRx reporters also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: \"The following disclosure provides many different embodiments, or examples, for implementing different features of the provided subject matter. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. For example, the formation of a first feature over or on a second feature in the description that follows may include embodiments in which the first and second features are formed in direct contact, and may also include embodiments in which additional features may be formed between the first and second features, such that the first and second features may not be in direct contact. In addition, the present disclosure may repeat reference numerals and\/or letters in the various examples. This repetition is for the purpose of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and\/or configurations discussed.\n\n\"Spatially relative terms, such as \"beneath,\" \"below,\" \"lower,\" \"above,\" \"upper\" and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. The spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. The apparatus may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein may likewise be interpreted accordingly.\n\n\"Further, when a number or a range of numbers is described with \"about,\" \"approximate,\" and the like, the term is intended to encompass numbers that are within a reasonable range considering variations that inherently arise during manufacturing as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, the number or range of numbers encompasses a reasonable range including the number described, such as within +\/-10% of the number described, based on known manufacturing tolerances associated with manufacturing a feature having a characteristic associated with the number. For example, a material layer having a thickness of \"about 5 nm\" can encompass a dimension range from 4.25 nm to 5.75 nm where manufacturing tolerances associated with depositing the material layer are known to be +\/-15% by one of ordinary skill in the art. Still further, the present disclosure may repeat reference numerals and\/or letters in the various examples. This repetition is for the purpose of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and\/or configurations discussed.\n\n\"Source\/drain contacts of transistors on a substrate are used to connect source\/drain features of the transistors to an interconnect structure over a front side of the substrate. As the dimensions of IC devices shrink, the process windows for forming these contacts are reduced, and parasitic capacitance associated with transistors may increase. Backside power rail (BPR) structure is a solution for performance boost on power delivery network (PDN) for advanced technology node and it eases the crowding of contacts. In some processes, an initial substrate for fabrication includes a semiconductor layer formed of silicon. Formation of backside power rails involves forming a dummy plug in the silicon layer, replacing the silicon layer with a dielectric layer, and replacing the dummy plug with a backside contact. In some implantations, to replace the silicon layer with the dielectric layer, a dry etching process may be used to remove the silicon layer. However, dry etching does not provide a good etch selectivity between the silicon layer and dummy plug, leading to a damaged and dimension-reduced dummy plug, and thus leading to a dimension-reduced backside contact. In addition, exposing frontside features (e.g., gate structures) to a bombardment of ions used in the dry etching process would disadvantageously influence performance of the device and\/or induce reliability issues. In some implantations, a wet etching process may be used to selectively remove the silicon layer. However, silicon has different crystal planes. The etch rate is dependent on crystal planes of the silicon due to, for example, their different bond configurations and atomic densities. For example, a wet etching process etches silicon more slowly along the <111> crystal orientation than all the other crystal orientations (e.g., <110>, <100>) in the lattice. Due to the etch rate difference, a portion of silicon may not be fully removed by the wet etching process and would remain at the back side. The unremoved silicon would disadvantageously introduce a leakage path between the backside contact and adjacent gate structures. Additionally or alternatively, because the dielectric constant of silicon is greater than the dielectric layer that replaces the silicon layer, the unremoved or residual silicon may increase a parasitic capacitance of the semiconductor structure, inducing reliability issues of the semiconductor structure. Alternatively, if the wet etching process is allowed to completely etch away the residual silicon layer, the gate structures may be damaged.\n\n\"The present disclosure provides processes for forming a backside power rail structure. In some embodiments, a fin-shape structure is formed over a semiconductor layer. A source region and a drain region of the fin-shape structure are recessed to form a source opening and a drain opening. Using photolithography techniques, the source opening is selectively extended through at least of a portion of the semiconductor layer to form an extended opening. A semiconductor plug is then formed to fill the extended opening. A source feature is formed in the source opening and over the silicon plug, and a drain feature is formed in the drain opening. After forming a functional gate structure and an interconnect structure over a front side of the workpiece, the workpiece is bonded to a carrier substrate, flipped over, and planarized to expose the semiconductor plug and the semiconductor layer. A pre-amorphous implantation (PAI) process is then performed to amorphize the lattice structure of the semiconductor layer and convert the crystalline semiconductor layer into an amorphous semiconductor layer. Without non-uniform etching due to different crystal orientations, the amorphous semiconductor layer would be uniformly etched under a wet etching process. The etchant in the wet etching process selectively removes the amorphous semiconductor layer without substantially etching the semiconductor plug. A dielectric layer is formed, and the semiconductor plug may be selectively removed to expose the source feature in a backside source contact opening. A backside source contact is then formed in the backside source contact opening. A backside power rail is then formed over the backside source contact.\"\n\nThe claims supplied by the inventors are:\n\n\"1.

Ltd. (Hsinchu, Taiwan) has been issued patent number 12224482, according to news reporting originating out of Alexandria, Virginia, by NewsRx editors.\n\nThe patent's inventors are Chang, Fong-Yuan (Hsinchu County, TW), Chu, Yi-Shin (Hsinchu, TW), Huang, Po-Hsiang (Tainan, TW), Wang, Tsui-Ping (Zhubei, TW).\n\nThis patent was filed on August 10, 2023 and was published online on February 11, 2025.\n\nFrom the background information supplied by the inventors, news correspondents obtained the following quote: \"The semiconductor integrated circuit (IC) industry has experienced rapid growth. Technological advances in IC materials and design have produced generations of ICs where each generation has smaller and more complex circuits than the previous generation. However, these advances have increased the complexity of processing and manufacturing ICs and, for these advances to be realized, similar developments in IC processing and manufacturing are needed. In the mainstream course of IC evolution, functional density (i.e., the number of interconnected devices per chip area) has generally increased while geometry size (i.e., the smallest component that can be created using a fabrication process) has decreased. However, this mainstream evolution needs to follow the Moore's rule by a huge investment in facility establishment. Therefore, it has been a constant need to develop ICs with lower power consumption, better performance, smaller chip areas, and lower costs.\"\n\nSupplementing the background information on this patent, NewsRx reporters also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: \"The following disclosure provides many different embodiments, or examples, for implementing different features of the provided subject matter. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. For example, the formation of a first feature over or on a second feature in the description that follows may include embodiments in which the first and second features are formed in direct contact, and may also include embodiments in which additional features may be formed between the first and second features, such that the first and second features may not be in direct contact. In addition, the present disclosure may repeat reference numerals and\/or letters in the various examples. This repetition is for the purpose of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and\/or configurations discussed.\n\n\"Further, spatially relative terms, such as \"beneath,\" \"below,\" \"lower,\" \"above,\" \"upper\" and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. The spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. The apparatus may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein may likewise be interpreted accordingly.\n\n\"An IC layout is generated after numerous steps of an IC design, also called a \"data preparation stage,\" and a series of checks in a process, called \"physical verification,\" at the end. Examples of common checks in this verification process are design rule checking (DRC), layout versus schematic (LVS), parasitic extraction, antenna rule checking which will be discussed in detail below, and electrical rule checking (ERC). When all verification is complete, the data in the IC layout is translated into an industry standard format, typically a vector-based format, such as GDSII or OASIS, and sent to a semiconductor foundry, called a fab house. The foundry then converts, via mask data preparation (MDP) procedure, the data into a set of instructions by which a photomask writer can generate a physical mask (a photomask) to be used in a photolithographic process of semiconductor device fabrication. More recent MDP procedures require the additional steps associated with design for manufacturability such as, resolution enhancement technologies (RET) and optical proximity correction (OPC). By using a series of photomasks, in addition to other processes, a wafer having one or more die (chips) is fabricated.\n\n\"The antenna effect, more formally plasma induced gate oxide damage, is an effect that can potentially cause yield and reliability problems during the manufacture of integrated circuits. In the manufacturing of an integrated circuit (IC) using Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) technology, processes involving charged ions are typically employed, such as a plasma etching process and an ion implantation process. As an example, during a plasma etching process used in forming gate polysilicon (poly) patterns or interconnect metal line patterns, electrostatic charges may accumulate on a floating gate poly electrode. The resulting voltage on the gate poly electrode may become so large that charges may flow into the gate oxide, become trapped in the gate oxide or flow through the gate oxide. These charges may significantly degrade the gate oxide strength and cause MOS device reliability failures.\n\n\"Each poly gate region collects an electrostatic charge proportional to its own area. A small gate oxide region connected to a large poly geometry or a large interconnect metal geometry through poly contacts can accumulate a disproportionate amount of charges (positive plasma ions in the case of a grounded or a negative biased wafer) and may suffer serious damage. This mechanism is commonly known as the antenna effect because the large poly or interconnect metal area act as an antenna to collect the electrostatic charges that flow through the vulnerable gate oxide. The strength of the antenna effect is proportional to the ratio between the exposed conductor area and the gate oxide area.\"\n\nThe claims supplied by the inventors are:\n\n\"1.

Ltd. (Hsinchu, Taiwan) has been issued patent number 12224298, according to news reporting originating out of Alexandria, Virginia, by NewsRx editors.\n\nThe patent's inventors are Chiang, Yen-Ting (Tainan, TW), Li, Yu-Hsien (Hsinchu, TW), Liu, Jen-Cheng (Hsin-Chu, TW), Ting, Shyh-Fann (Tainan, TW), Yaung, Dun-Nian (Taipei, TW).\n\nThis patent was filed on August 2, 2021 and was published online on February 11, 2025.\n\nFrom the background information supplied by the inventors, news correspondents obtained the following quote: \"Many modern-day electronic devices include complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) image sensors that convert optical images to digital data representing the optical images. One type of CMOS image sensor commonly used in electronic devices is a backside illuminated (BSI) image sensor. A BSI image sensor comprises an interconnect structure on a frontside of a semiconductor substrate and is configured to receive radiation from a backside of the semiconductor substrate, opposite the frontside. This arrangement allows the radiation to impinge on photodetectors in the semiconductor substrate without being obstructed by conductive features in the interconnect structure.\"\n\nSupplementing the background information on this patent, NewsRx reporters also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: \"The present disclosure provides many different embodiments, or examples, for implementing different features of this disclosure. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. For example, the formation of a first feature over or on a second feature in the description that follows may include embodiments in which the first and second features are formed in direct contact, and may also include embodiments in which additional features may be formed between the first and second features, such that the first and second features may not be in direct contact. In addition, the present disclosure may repeat reference numerals and\/or letters in the various examples. This repetition is for the purpose of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and\/or configurations discussed.\n\n\"Further, spatially relative terms, such as \"beneath,\" \"below,\" \"lower,\" \"above,\" \"upper\" and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. The spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. The apparatus may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein may likewise be interpreted accordingly.\n\n\"An integrated circuit (IC) chip may comprise an interconnect structure on a frontside of a semiconductor substrate and a bond pad structure on a backside of the semiconductor substrate, opposite the frontside. Such an IC chip may, for example, correspond to a backside illuminated (BSI) image sensor. The interconnect structure comprises a plurality wires and a plurality of inter-wire vias respectively grouped into a plurality of wire levels and a plurality of via levels. The wire levels are alternatingly stacked with the via levels and form a columnar structure. The bond pad structure extends through the semiconductor substrate to the columnar structure and electrically couples to a semiconductor device on the front side of the semiconductor substrate through the columnar structure.\n\n\"A challenge with the IC chip is that inter-wire vias of the columnar structure may have a low density between a top via level and the semiconductor substrate. For example, the inter-wire vias may have a density less than about 1 percent or some other suitable value. Via density is determined per via level and corresponds to a ratio of via area to wire area respectively for the inter-wire vias at a given via level and an adjoining wire. The via area may, for example, correspond to a top layout area of the inter-wire vias, and the wire area may, for example, correspond to a top layout area of the adjoining wire. Additionally, the wire levels between the top via level and the semiconductor substrate may have small thicknesses, which are only expected to become smaller as IC chips continue to scale down. For example, the wire levels may have thicknesses less than about 1000 angstroms or some other suitable value. The combination of small wire thickness and low via density results in the columnar structure being weak proximate the bond pad structure, whereby the columnar structure has a high likelihood of peeling and hence failure in response to shear force on the bond pad structure.\n\n\"Various embodiments of the present disclosure are directed towards an IC chip in which a bond pad structure extends to a columnar structure with a high via density at via levels between a top via level and a semiconductor substrate. Such a high via density may, for example, correspond to a via density of more than about 10% or some other suitable value. Because of the high via density, the columnar structure is strong even with wire levels having small thicknesses. Because the columnar structure is strong, shear force on the bond pad structure has a low likelihood of causing peeling and hence failure at the columnar structure. This may, in turn, increase yields when wire bonding or otherwise bonding to the bond pad structure. Further, because of the low likelihood, the IC chip may be scaled down more than would otherwise be possible.\"\n\nThe claims supplied by the inventors are:\n\n\"1.

        "Story":"TSM Stock Rises Despite Tariff ConcernsMar 04, 2025\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSM, Financial) is seeing a positive movement in the stock market today. The stock is currently priced at $176.50, reflecting a 2.04% increase due to the company's strategic announcement to invest an additional $100 billion in new chip foundries in the U.S.\n\nTSMC had already committed to a $65 billion investment in U.S. factories under the CHIPS Act. This expanded investment is perceived as a strategic effort to enhance its manufacturing presence in the U.S., in alignment with the government\u2019s push for increased domestic production. This move also aims to reduce dependency on its base in Taiwan, which is considered susceptible to geopolitical tensions with China.\n\nThe market's positive reaction to TSMC's expansion plans emphasizes the strengthening of its competitive position globally. Despite the broader market's concerns over tariffs affecting chip stocks, TSMC's strategic U.S. investments showcase its edge over chip-designing rivals who face global price and demand risks.\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, TSMC\u2019s stock trades with a price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio of 25.11. The stock is considered to be fairly valued with a GF Value of $160.60, according to GF Value metrics. TSMC demonstrates strong financial strength, highlighted by an Altman Z-score of 8.91 and a Piotroski F-Score of 9, indicating a healthy financial situation. The company's robust operating margin of 45.68% further contributes to its attractiveness as an investment.\n\nDespite the challenges in the semiconductor industry, TSMC's continuous growth and strategic investments position it well for future advancements. The company maintains a strong Altman Z-score and positive financial strength indicators, making its stock an attractive option for investors seeking exposure in the semiconductor sector.\n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Wei, anunci\u00f3 este lunes que la empresa taiwanesa de semiconductores planea realizar una inversi\u00f3n adicional de 100 mil millones de d\u00f3lares en Estados Unidos y construir otras cinco f\u00e1bricas de chips en los pr\u00f3ximos a\u00f1os.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co anunci\u00f3 el plan en una reuni\u00f3n en la Casa Blanca con Donald Trump. \"Debemos ser capaces de construir los chips y semiconductores que necesitamos aqu\u00ed mismo\", dijo el mandatario \"Es una cuesti\u00f3n de seguridad nacional para nosotros\".\n\nTSMC, el mayor fabricante de chips por contrato del mundo, es uno de los principales proveedores de los fabricantes m\u00e1s importantes de hardware de Estados Unidos.\n\nEl desembolso de 100 mil millones de d\u00f3lares, que impulsar\u00eda la producci\u00f3n nacional y har\u00eda a Estados Unidos menos dependiente de los semiconductores fabricados en Asia, se suma a un importante anuncio de inversi\u00f3n anterior.\n\nTSMC acord\u00f3 en abril ampliar su inversi\u00f3n prevista en pa\u00eds en 25 mil millones de d\u00f3lares, hasta 65 mil millones, y a\u00f1adir una tercera f\u00e1brica en Arizona para 2030.\n\nCon su victoria electoral del 5 de noviembre impulsada en gran medida por las preocupaciones econ\u00f3micas de los votantes, Trump ha intensificado sus esfuerzos para reforzar las inversiones en las industrias nacionales con el fin de crear empleo.\n\nEl anuncio de TSMC es el \u00faltimo de una serie de acontecimientos de este tipo. En febrero, Apple dijo que invertir\u00eda 500 mil millones de d\u00f3lares en los pr\u00f3ximos cuatro a\u00f1os. El multimillonario emirat\u00ed Hussain Sajwani y SoftBank tambi\u00e9n han prometido fuertes inversiones en Estados Unidos.\n\nTSMC dijo el lunes que espera \"con inter\u00e9s discutir nuestra visi\u00f3n compartida para la innovaci\u00f3n y el crecimiento en la industria de semiconductores, as\u00ed como explorar formas de impulsar el sector de la tecnolog\u00eda junto con nuestros clientes\"."

US President Donald Trump on Monday announced the TSMC investment in three new chip-fabrication plants, two packaging facilities, and a research and development centre, potentially adding 20,000 to 25,000 jobs in the US state of Arizona.\n\nThe president, who advocates more onshoring of industry to stimulate the US economy, said that without TSMC's commitment, tariffs on its chip imports might otherwise reach an eventual 25-50 per cent.\n\nOther major East Asian chipmakers will probably move production to the US, too, as \"the Trump administration's threat of tariffs on imported semiconductors poses a serious challenge for the region's tech-heavy economies\", said Jeemin Bang, a Taiwan analyst for Moody's Analytics.\n\nSouth Korean electronics giants LG and Samsung, for example, were considering moving plants to the US, Korean media outlets reported in January. Both companies develop chips.\n\nThe White House statement said Trump had \"secured\" nearly US$2 trillion in US-based investment and that \"the best is yet to come\"."

        "Story":"Taiwan Semiconductor, Intel Navigate Shift As Trump Looks To Slash Chips Act Workforce By 40%The U.S. Chips Program Office will lose close to forty percent of its staff, marking a divergence in President\u00a0Donald Trump's strategy\u00a0from that of Joe Biden.\n\nThe reduction includes around 20 employees who accepted a voluntary deferred resignation and left the U.S. government office last week, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter. Reportedly, the Trump administration will terminate the office of another 40 who are considered probationary on Monday.\n\nAlso Read: Taiwan Semiconductor Weighs $100 Billion US Investment As Chip War Heats Up\n\nThe 2022 program the Biden administration inked includes $39 billion in manufacturing grants to companies like\u00a0Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) and\u00a0Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC), plus $11 billion for research and development. It has prompted well over $400 billion in promised private investment.\n\nCommerce Secretary\u00a0Howard Lutnick suggested to Bloomberg that Trump tariffs have an edge over the erstwhile Chips Act.\n\nHe lauded how Trump convinced Taiwan Semiconductor to boost its U.S. investment by $100 billion to avoid tariffs instead of the erstwhile $65 billion Arizona fab investment in return for a 10% subsidy.\n\nThe Biden administration built an office of about 140 people to oversee the Chips Act manufacturing spending, in addition to staff responsible for R&D funding.\n\nThe semiconductor supply chain disruption due to the 2020 pandemic and alleged national security threats from countries like China prompted countries like the U.S., Europe, and Japan to consolidate the domestic semiconductor base.\n\nTherefore, they forged deals with the chipmakers to construct fabs in their countries to develop advanced semiconductor technology, notably artificial intelligence technology, to unlock value.\n\nU.S. Big Tech giants have downsized by a couple of thousands, citing a pandemic-induced slowdown, an efficiency drive, and other factors.\n\nIn 2022, Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) let go of its workforce, affecting 27,000 positions. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) fired 10,000 employees in 2023, losing 4%-5% of its workforce. In 2023, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u00a0Google\u00a0slashed 12,000 jobs, affecting ~6% of its workforce. Since November 2022, Meta\u00a0Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) laid off 21,000 employees or 25% of its workforce.\u00a0\n\nAlso Read:\n\n * Intel Gains Traction With 18A Process As Nvidia, Broadcom Consider Manufacturing Contracts\n\nPhoto: Nazrul Iznan via Shuttestock\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga | All Rights Reserved Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

Wei outlined plans to build three chip fabrication plants, two packaging facilities, and an R&D center. This expansion will bring the total investment at the Arizona site to $165 billion, marking a major step in boosting domestic semiconductor production.\n\nFor economic and national security, Trump assured us that \u201cthe most powerful AI chips in the world will be made right here in America.\u201d However, it comes as Trump has vowed to slap tariffs of at least 25% on semiconductor imports on March 2 and on further products from Canada and Mexico on Tuesday.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024 TSMC's first Arizona factory will start production and is already in discussions to manufacture Nvidia Blackwell chips. Meanwhile, the project also received $6.6 billion of federal funding under the CHIPS and Science Act, which ensures U.S. is committed globally to a strong chip industry.\n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

        "Headline":"TSMC is dropping a $100 billion investment in the US",
        "Story":"TSMC is dropping a $100 billion investment in the USMar 04, 2025\n\nIn its ongoing trade war with China, the US just scored a major win. President Donald Trump has announced that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) will make an investment of $100 billion in the US. Trump also called them the \u201cmost powerful company in the world.\u201d\n\nTSMC\u2019s $100 billion investment in the US is just one of several investments the company has made over the years. TSMC has fabs located in its home turf of Taiwan. It also operates in China and Germany. In 2020, the company made its first expansion to the US, opening up shop in Arizona. The company had committed $65 billion to building three factories in Arizona. The latest $100 billion investment will go toward two additional chip manufacturing facilities located in Phoenix. This brings the total investment to $165 billion.\n\nExpanding its US presence\n\nThe company\u2019s investment follows that of its long-time partner and customer, Apple, which announced its own $500 billion investment in the US economy. According to Dr. C.C. Wei, TSMC Chairman and CEO, \u201cBack in 2020, thanks to President Trump\u2019s vision and support, we embarked on our journey of establishing advanced chip manufacturing in the United States. This vision is now a reality. AI is reshaping our daily lives and semiconductor technology is the foundation for new capabilities and applications. With the success of our first fab in Arizona, along with needed government support and strong customer partnerships, we intend to expand our U.S. semiconductor manufacturing investment by an additional $100 billion, bringing our total planned investment to $165 billion.\u201d\n\nTSMC\u2019s ever-growing presence\n\nTSMC is a major player in the semiconductor industry. In fact, it would be accurate to call the company the largest semiconductor company in the word. TSMC has many notable customers under its belt. This includes Apple. The Cupertino company heavily relies on TSMC\u2019s advanced manufacturing capabilities to produce chipsets used in the iPhone, iPad, and Mac computers.\n\nTSMC also supplies semiconductors to other major industry players. This includes NVIDIA, who is one of the largest producers of hardware used in AI development. They also supply chipsets to Qualcomm, whose Snapdragon components can be found in almost every Android device out there.\n\nThe company\u2019s investment in the US will help grow its operations further, but it\u2019s not hard to see that it is also a political move, one designed to stay in Trump\u2019s good graces while he remains the President of the US.\n\nThe post TSMC is dropping a $100 billion investment in the US appeared first on Android Headlines.\n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

        "Headline":"Trump: China's invasion of Taiwan would be \"catastrophic\"",
        "Story":"Trump: China's invasion of Taiwan would be \"catastrophic\"An invasion of Taiwan by China \"would obviously be a catastrophic event,\" said Trump at a White House ceremony, announcing an investment in the United States by Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturing giant TSMC, worth 100 billion dollars (95 billion euros).\n\nThis investment \"will at least give us a position where we will have, in this very, very important business, a very large share in the United States,\" said Trump.\n\nTrump has successively avoided clarifying his position on US protection of Taiwan against an invasion by China, a scenario not ruled out by Beijing, which claims sovereignty over the island that has an autonomous, democratically elected government.\n\n\"I never comment on that (...) I don't comment on that because I don't want to put myself in that position,\" said the US President last week, when asked about his administration's position in the event of an invasion of Taiwan.\n\nWashington's treatment of long-standing allies - threatening to seize the Danish territory of Greenland or make Canada the 51st province of the United States, for example - has unsettled other partners who depend on US support, such as Tawan.\n\nLast week, Trump also reiterated that he has a \"great relationship\" with Chinese President Xi Jinping and said that Washington welcomes good relations with Beijing.\n\n\"I hear so many things about not wanting China in this country (...). That's not true. We want them to invest in the United States. That's good. There's a lot of money coming in and we're going to invest in China. We're going to do things with China. The relationship we're going to have with China is going to be very good,\" said the US President.\n\nAlthough the US wants to have a good relationship with China, he said, \"they're not going to be able to take advantage of us like they did with [former President Joe] Biden\".\n\nTrump's investment in TSMC today was negotiated by Biden and had already been announced by him."

It will support the development of three new advanced chip plants, expanding beyond TSMC's existing facility and two ongoing projects in Arizona. The expansion is expected to generate tens of thousands of jobs. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the world's biggest semiconductor manufacturer, plans to invest $100 billion in the United States, in addition to the $65 billion it had previously announced, President Donald Trump announced Monday.\n\nThis move aligns with Trump's broader push to boost investments in American manufacturing. The investment will support the development of three new advanced chip plants, expanding beyond TSMC's existing facility and two ongoing projects in Arizona. The expansion is expected to generate tens of thousands of jobs, CNN [https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2025\/03\/03\/tech\/tsmc-trump-meeting-chipmaking-investment\/index.html] reported.\n\nTrump Hails TSMC Investment As Key To U.S. Economic Security\n\nSpeaking alongside TSMC CEO C.C. Wei at the White House, President Trump hailed the investment as a critical step for enhancing U.S. economic security. TSMC is a key supplier of semiconductors to major tech companies such as Apple, Intel, and Nvidia.\n\n\"Semiconductors are the backbone of the 21st century economy. And really, without the semiconductors, there is no economy,\" the president said, according to AP News [https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/trump-tsmc-chip-manufacturing-tariffs-42980704ffca62e823182422ee4b7b83] .\n\n\"Powering everything from AI to automobiles to advanced manufacturing, we must be able to build the chips and semiconductors that we need right here in American factories with Americans skill and American labor,\" Trump added.\n\n\"This is a tremendous move by the most powerful company in the world. It's a matter of economic security, it's also a matter of national security for us,\" Trump further said, adding that it will also help TSMC diversify away from its current chipmaking operations in Taiwan.\n\nAccording to Trump, TSMC's investment \u2014 along with other similar initiatives \u2014 could help the United States capture 40% of the global chipmaking market.\n\n\"We're going to produce many chips to support AI progress and to support smartphones progress,\" Wei said. He also thanked TSMC customers such as Apple, Nvidia, AMD and Qualcomm.\n\nFollowing the announcement, an Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement that TSMC's new fabs \"will be the foundational pillar of a new technology supply chain centered in the United States,\" adding the company \"will fully utilize TSMC's global manufacturing network to enhance our supply agility and resilience.\"\n\nTSMC Investment, U.S. Chip Policy, And Trump's Tariff Strategy\n\nAccording to CEO C.C. Wei, TSMC's $165 billion investment will create thousands of high-paying jobs. In 2022, former President Joe Biden signed the $280 billion CHIPS and Science Act to boost U.S. chip manufacturing, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe pandemic caused many overseas chip factories to close, leading to severe supply shortages. This disruption affected industries, halting car production and contributing to inflation. Trump criticized the CHIPS Act, advocating instead for high tariffs on imported chips to incentivize domestic production.\n\nJob Cuts & Geopolitical Concerns Amid TSMC Investment\n\nAlso, on Monday, 40 employees from the U.S. Commerce Department who were involved in the CHIPS Act were fired as part of Trump's efforts to reduce the federal workforce, according to sources familiar with the decision.\n\nWhen asked whether the new investment could help minimize the impact on the U.S. in the event that China isolates or seizes Taiwan, Trump said that it was impossible to \"minimize\" such a scenario, calling it \"a catastrophic event.\"\n\nLast week, Trump met Apple CEO Tim Cook at the White House. Following the meeting [https:\/\/www.ibtimes.com\/apple-claims-software-switching-racist-trump-bug-3764909] , Apple announced a $500 billion investment in the U.S. over the next four years, including a new server factory in Texas.\n\nThe views expressed in content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex et al.

The move significantly boosts TSMC's total U.S. investment to $165 billion and will fund the construction of five new fabrication facilities in Arizona.\n\nHailing the investment as a 'tremendous move by the most powerful company in the world,' Trump emphasized its role in advancing America's position as a global leader in artificial intelligence and semiconductor production. TSMC, a key supplier for Nvidia and Apple, plays a critical role in AI chip manufacturing.\n\nThe announcement aligns with the Trump administration's broader push to strengthen U.S. AI infrastructure and semiconductor independence. Last month, Trump unveiled a multibillion-dollar AI infrastructure project in collaboration with Oracle, OpenAI, and SoftBank. He has consistently advocated for reshoring semiconductor manufacturing, citing both economic and national security concerns.\n\nTrump has previously accused Taiwan of undermining U.S. chip manufacturing and has promoted tariffs on semiconductor imports. However, TSMC has been expanding its U.S. footprint for years. The company initially committed $12 billion in 2020 for its first Arizona plant, later increasing its investment to $65 billion with a third factory. TSMC has also secured $6.6 billion in subsidies from the U.S. Commerce Department.\n\nWendell Huang, TSMC's Chief Financial Officer, expressed confidence that the new administration would continue to support the company's expansion efforts. A spokesperson for Nvidia affirmed that the company would leverage TSMC's global manufacturing network to enhance supply chain resilience.\n\nThis latest investment marks a major step in bolstering America's semiconductor industry, reinforcing its strategic importance in the AI revolution."

        "Story":"Trump announces $100 billion investment by chipmaker TSMCUS President Donald Trump announced on Monday an investment of 100 billion dollars from the world's largest manufacturer of advanced chips, Taiwan's TSMC, in line with the plan activated years ago by Washington to increase domestic semiconductor production.\n\nThe plan announced by Trump at the White House contemplates that the Taiwanese giant will invest that amount, which is in addition to another $65 billion it already committed to disburse last year, over the next few years in Phoenix (Arizona), where it already owns a plant that recently began operating and plans to open two additional ones in 2028 and 2030.\n\nAs explained by Trump and C.C. Wei, CEO of TSMC, the capital investment would go to these three factories and two others (including one for integrated circuit encapsulation), also located in the state of Arizona. With this capital investment, Trump said that between 20,000 and 25,000 new jobs would be created and that the US will be close to producing 40% of the world's advanced chips.\n\nThis expands TSMC's plan to disburse on U.S. soil, which had so far committed to the previous administration to invest some $65 billion in this country. Under President Joe Biden's administration the company was awarded a grant package valued at about $6.6 billion under the chip bill passed in 2022.\n\nThe supply of chips is considered a matter of national security in the US - as Trump recalled today - and this rule seeks to attract semiconductor production, especially of the most sophisticated integrated circuits, to the domestic arena in order to be less dependent on foreign supply chains.\n\nIt is estimated that TSMC, which still concentrates its production mainly in Taiwan, holds around 90% of the global market share of advanced integrated circuits, essential for US companies such as Nvidia or Apple and technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) or the internet of things (IoT).\n\nThere is uncertainty as to whether the Trump administration, which at the time called the 2022 chip bill \"very bad\", will maintain that subsidy program.\n\nFor his part, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick added even more doubt on the matter, noting Monday at the White House that TSMC has committed to this additional investment without the need for further subsidies and that it has done so in order to \"be able to avoid paying tariffs.\"\n\nTrump has floated the idea of eliminating the chip bill and imposing 25% tariffs on large semiconductor manufacturers as a pressure measure to locate higher production volumes on U.S. soil."
